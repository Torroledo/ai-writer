Conclusion\\n\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\n“The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us,” admits\\nProfessor Aronnax early in this novel. “What goes on in those distant\\ndepths? What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve\\nor fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? It’s almost beyond\\nconjecture.”\\n\\nJules Verne (1828-1905) published the French equivalents of these\\nwords in 1869, and little has changed since. 126 years later, a Time\\ncover story on deep-sea exploration made much the same admission: “We\\nknow more about Mars than we know about the oceans.” This reality\\nbegins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of\\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.\\n\\nBorn in the French river town of Nantes, Verne had a lifelong passion\\nfor the sea. First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated\\nauthor and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages—to Britain, America,\\nthe Mediterranean. But the specific stimulus for this novel was an\\n1865 fan letter from a fellow writer, Madame George Sand. She praised\\nVerne’s two early novels Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to\\nthe Center of the Earth (1864), then added: “Soon I hope you’ll take\\nus into the ocean depths, your characters traveling in diving\\nequipment perfected by your science and your imagination.” Thus\\ninspired, Verne created one of literature’s great rebels, a freedom\\nfighter who plunged beneath the waves to wage a unique form of\\nguerilla warfare.\\n\\nInitially, Verne’s narrative was influenced by the 1863 uprising of\\nPoland against Tsarist Russia. The Poles were quashed with a violence\\nthat appalled not only Verne but all Europe. As originally conceived,\\nVerne’s Captain Nemo was a Polish nobleman whose entire family had\\nbeen slaughtered by Russian troops. Nemo builds a fabulous futuristic\\nsubmarine, the Nautilus, then conducts an underwater campaign of\\nvengeance against his imperialist oppressor.\\n\\nBut in the 1860s France had to treat the Tsar as an ally, and Verne’s\\npublisher Pierre Hetzel pronounced the book unprintable. Verne\\nreworked its political content, devising new nationalities for Nemo\\nand his great enemy—information revealed only in a later novel, The\\nMysterious Island (1875); in the present work Nemo’s background\\nremains a dark secret. In all, the novel had a difficult\\ngestation. Verne and Hetzel were in constant conflict and the book\\nwent through multiple drafts, struggles reflected in its several\\nworking titles over the period 1865-69: early on, it was variously\\ncalled Voyage Under the Waters, Twenty-five Thousand Leagues Under the\\nWaters, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Waters, and A Thousand\\nLeagues Under the Oceans.\\n\\nVerne is often dubbed, in Isaac Asimov’s phrase, “the world’s first\\nscience-fiction writer.” And it’s true, many of his sixty-odd books do\\nanticipate future events and technologies: From the Earth to the Moon\\n(1865) and Hector Servadac (1877) deal in space travel, while Journey\\nto the Center of the Earth features travel to the earth’s core. But\\nwith Verne the operative word is “travel,” and some of his best-known\\ntitles don’t really qualify as sci-fi: Around the World in Eighty Days\\n(1872) and Michael Strogoff (1876) are closer to “travelogs”—adventure\\nyarns in far-away places.\\n\\nThese observations partly apply here. The subtitle of the present book\\nis An Underwater Tour of the World, so in good travelog style, the\\nNautilus’s exploits supply an episodic story line. Shark attacks,\\ngiant squid, cannibals, hurricanes, whale hunts, and other rip-roaring\\nadventures erupt almost at random. Yet this loose structure gives the\\nnovel an air of documentary realism. What’s more, Verne adds backbone\\nto the action by developing three recurring motifs: the deepening\\nmystery of Nemo’s past life and future intentions, the mounting\\ntension between Nemo and hot-tempered harpooner Ned Land, and Ned’s\\nongoing schemes to escape from the Nautilus. These unifying threads\\ntighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum.\\n\\nOther subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling\\nwith wit, information, and insight. Verne regards the sea from many\\nangles: in the domain of marine biology, he gives us thumbnail\\nsketches of fish, seashells, coral, sometimes in great catalogs that\\nswirl past like musical cascades; in the realm of geology, he studies\\nvolcanoes literally inside and out; in the world of commerce, he\\ncelebrates the high-energy entrepreneurs who lay the Atlantic Cable or\\ndig the Suez Canal. And Verne’s marine engineering proves especially\\nauthoritative. His specifications for an open-sea submarine and a\\nself-contained diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern\\ntechnology bears them out triumphantly.\\n\\nTrue, today’s scientists know a few things he didn’t: the South Pole\\nisn’t at the water’s edge but far inland; sharks don’t flip over\\nbefore attacking; giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight; sperm\\nwhales don’t prey on their whalebone cousins. This notwithstanding,\\nVerne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths\\nbefore the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film.\\n\\nLastly the book has stature as a novel of character. Even the\\nsupporting cast is shrewdly drawn: Professor Aronnax, the career\\nscientist caught in an ethical conflict; Conseil, the compulsive\\nclassifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne’s fast facts; the\\nharpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites, man as heroic\\nanimal.\\n\\nBut much of the novel’s brooding power comes from Captain\\nNemo. Inventor, musician, Renaissance genius, he’s a trail-blazing\\ncreation, the prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in\\npopular fiction, but even for such varied figures as Sherlock Holmes\\nor Wolf Larsen. However, Verne gives his hero’s brilliance and\\nbenevolence a dark underside—the man’s obsessive hate for his old\\nenemy. This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions: he’s a\\nfighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there\\nfor good; he works to save lives, both human and animal, yet he\\nhimself creates a holocaust; he detests imperialism, yet he lays\\npersonal claim to the South Pole. And in this last action he falls\\ninto the classic sin of Pride. He’s swiftly punished. The Nautilus\\nnearly perishes in the Antarctic and Nemo sinks into a growing\\ndepression.\\n\\nLike Shakespeare’s King Lear he courts death and madness in a great\\nstorm, then commits mass murder, collapses in catatonic paralysis, and\\nsuicidally runs his ship into the ocean’s most dangerous\\nwhirlpool. Hate swallows him whole.\\n\\nFor many, then, this book has been a source of fascination, surely one\\nof the most influential novels ever written, an inspiration for such\\nscientists and discoverers as engineer Simon Lake, oceanographer\\nWilliam Beebe, polar traveler Sir Ernest Shackleton. Likewise\\nDr. Robert D. Ballard, finder of the sunken Titanic, confesses that\\nthis was his favorite book as a teenager, and Cousteau himself, most\\nrenowned of marine explorers, called it his shipboard bible.\\n\\nThe present translation is a faithful yet communicative rendering of\\nthe original French texts published in Paris by J. Hetzel et Cie.—the\\nhardcover first edition issued in the autumn of 1871, collated with\\nthe softcover editions of the First and Second Parts issued separately\\nin the autumn of 1869 and the summer of 1870. Although prior English\\nversions have often been heavily abridged, this new translation is\\ncomplete to the smallest substantive detail.\\n\\nBecause, as that Time cover story suggests, we still haven’t caught up\\nwith Verne. Even in our era of satellite dishes and video games, the\\nseas keep their secrets. We’ve seen progress in sonar, torpedoes, and\\nother belligerent machinery, but sailors and scientists—to say nothing\\nof tourists—have yet to voyage in a submarine with the luxury and\\nefficiency of the Nautilus.\\n\\nF.

Without getting into those rumors that upset civilians in\\nthe seaports and deranged the public mind even far inland, it must be\\nsaid that professional seamen were especially alarmed. Traders,\\nshipowners, captains of vessels, skippers, and master mariners from\\nEurope and America, naval officers from every country, and at their\\nheels the various national governments on these two continents, were\\nall extremely disturbed by the business.\\n\\nIn essence, over a period of time several ships had encountered “an\\nenormous thing” at sea, a long spindle-shaped object, sometimes giving\\noff a phosphorescent glow, infinitely bigger and faster than any\\nwhale.\\n\\nThe relevant data on this apparition, as recorded in various logbooks,\\nagreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or creature in\\nquestion, its unprecedented speed of movement, its startling\\nlocomotive power, and the unique vitality with which it seemed to be\\ngifted. If it was a cetacean, it exceeded in bulk any whale previously\\nclassified by science. No naturalist, neither Cuvier nor Lacépède,\\nneither Professor Dumeril nor Professor de Quatrefages, would have\\naccepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen—specifically,\\nunseen by their own scientific eyes.\\n\\nStriking an average of observations taken at different times—rejecting\\nthose timid estimates that gave the object a length of 200 feet, and\\nignoring those exaggerated views that saw it as a mile wide and three\\nlong—you could still assert that this phenomenal creature greatly\\nexceeded the dimensions of anything then known to ichthyologists, if\\nit existed at all.\\n\\nNow then, it did exist, this was an undeniable fact; and since the\\nhuman mind dotes on objects of wonder, you can understand the\\nworldwide excitement caused by this unearthly apparition. As for\\nrelegating it to the realm of fiction, that charge had to be dropped.\\n\\nIn essence, on July 20, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, from the\\nCalcutta & Burnach Steam Navigation Co., encountered this moving mass\\nfive miles off the eastern shores of Australia.\\n\\nCaptain Baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown\\nreef; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts\\nshot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air\\nsome 150 feet. So, unless this reef was subject to the intermittent\\neruptions of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had fair and honest\\ndealings with some aquatic mammal, until then unknown, that could\\nspurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam.\\n\\nSimilar events were likewise observed in Pacific seas, on July 23 of\\nthe same year, by the Christopher Columbus from the West India &\\nPacific Steam Navigation Co. Consequently, this extraordinary cetacean\\ncould transfer itself from one locality to another with startling\\nswiftness, since within an interval of just three days, the Governor\\nHigginson and the Christopher Columbus had observed it at two\\npositions on the charts separated by a distance of more than 700\\nnautical leagues.\\n\\nFifteen days later and 2,000 leagues farther, the Helvetia from the\\nCompagnie Nationale and the Shannon from the Royal Mail line, running\\non opposite tacks in that part of the Atlantic lying between the\\nUnited States and Europe, respectively signaled each other that the\\nmonster had been sighted in latitude 42 degrees 15’ north and\\nlongitude 60 degrees 35’ west of the meridian of Greenwich. From their\\nsimultaneous observations, they were able to estimate the mammal’s\\nminimum length at more than 350 English feet;* this was because both\\nthe Shannon and the Helvetia were of smaller dimensions, although each\\nmeasured 100 meters stem to stern. Now then, the biggest whales, those\\nrorqual whales that frequent the waterways of the Aleutian Islands,\\nhave never exceeded a length of 56 meters—if they reach even that.\\n\\n*Author’s Note: About 106 meters. An English foot is only 30.4\\n centimeters.\\n\\nOne after another, reports arrived that would profoundly affect public\\nopinion: new observations taken by the transatlantic liner Pereire,\\nthe Inman line’s Etna running afoul of the monster, an official report\\ndrawn up by officers on the French frigate Normandy, dead-earnest\\nreckonings obtained by the general staff of Commodore Fitz-James\\naboard the Lord Clyde. In lighthearted countries, people joked about\\nthis phenomenon, but such serious, practical countries as England,\\nAmerica, and Germany were deeply concerned.\\n\\nIn every big city the monster was the latest rage; they sang about it\\nin the coffee houses, they ridiculed it in the newspapers, they\\ndramatized it in the theaters. The tabloids found it a fine\\nopportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes. In those newspapers\\nshort of copy, you saw the reappearance of every gigantic imaginary\\ncreature, from “Moby Dick,” that dreadful white whale from the High\\nArctic regions, to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles could entwine\\na 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths. They even reprinted\\nreports from ancient times: the views of Aristotle and Pliny accepting\\nthe existence of such monsters, then the Norwegian stories of Bishop\\nPontoppidan, the narratives of Paul Egede, and finally the reports of\\nCaptain Harrington—whose good faith is above suspicion—in which he\\nclaims he saw, while aboard the Castilian in 1857, one of those\\nenormous serpents that, until then, had frequented only the seas of\\nFrance’s old extremist newspaper, The Constitutionalist.\\n\\nAn interminable debate then broke out between believers and skeptics\\nin the scholarly societies and scientific journals. The “monster\\nquestion” inflamed all minds. During this memorable campaign,\\njournalists making a profession of science battled with those making a\\nprofession of wit, spilling waves of ink and some of them even two or\\nthree drops of blood, since they went from sea serpents to the most\\noffensive personal remarks.\\n\\nFor six months the war seesawed. With inexhaustible zest, the popular\\npress took potshots at feature articles from the Geographic Institute\\nof Brazil, the Royal Academy of Science in Berlin, the British\\nAssociation, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., at\\ndiscussions in The Indian Archipelago, in Cosmos published by Father\\nMoigno, in Petermann’s Mittheilungen,* and at scientific chronicles in\\nthe great French and foreign newspapers. When the monster’s detractors\\ncited a saying by the botanist Linnaeus that “nature doesn’t make\\nleaps,” witty writers in the popular periodicals parodied it,\\nmaintaining in essence that “nature doesn’t make lunatics,” and\\nordering their contemporaries never to give the lie to nature by\\nbelieving in krakens, sea serpents, “Moby Dicks,” and other all-out\\nefforts from drunken seamen. Finally, in a much-feared satirical\\njournal, an article by its most popular columnist finished off the\\nmonster for good, spurning it in the style of Hippolytus repulsing the\\namorous advances of his stepmother Phaedra, and giving the creature\\nits quietus amid a universal burst of laughter. Wit had defeated\\nscience.\\n\\n*German: “Bulletin.” Ed.\\n\\nDuring the first months of the year 1867, the question seemed to be\\nburied, and it didn’t seem due for resurrection, when new facts were\\nbrought to the public’s attention. But now it was no longer an issue\\nof a scientific problem to be solved, but a quite real and serious\\ndanger to be avoided. The question took an entirely new turn. The\\nmonster again became an islet, rock, or reef, but a runaway reef,\\nunfixed and elusive.\\n\\nOn March 5, 1867, the Moravian from the Montreal Ocean Co., lying\\nduring the night in latitude 27 degrees 30’ and longitude 72 degrees\\n15’, ran its starboard quarter afoul of a rock marked on no charts of\\nthese waterways. Under the combined efforts of wind and 400-horsepower\\nsteam, it was traveling at a speed of thirteen knots. Without the high\\nquality of its hull, the Moravian would surely have split open from\\nthis collision and gone down together with those 237 passengers it was\\nbringing back from Canada.\\n\\nThis accident happened around five o’clock in the morning, just as day\\nwas beginning to break. The officers on watch rushed to the craft’s\\nstern. They examined the ocean with the most scrupulous care. They saw\\nnothing except a strong eddy breaking three cable lengths out, as if\\nthose sheets of water had been violently churned. The site’s exact\\nbearings were taken, and the Moravian continued on course apparently\\nundamaged. Had it run afoul of an underwater rock or the wreckage of\\nsome enormous derelict ship? They were unable to say. But when they\\nexamined its undersides in the service yard, they discovered that part\\nof its keel had been smashed.\\n\\nThis occurrence, extremely serious in itself, might perhaps have been\\nforgotten like so many others, if three weeks later it hadn’t been\\nreenacted under identical conditions. Only, thanks to the nationality\\nof the ship victimized by this new ramming, and thanks to the\\nreputation of the company to which this ship belonged, the event\\ncaused an immense uproar.\\n\\nNo one is unaware of the name of that famous English shipowner,\\nCunard. In 1840 this shrewd industrialist founded a postal service\\nbetween Liverpool and Halifax, featuring three wooden ships with\\n400-horsepower paddle wheels and a burden of 1,162 metric tons. Eight\\nyears later, the company’s assets were increased by four\\n650-horsepower ships at 1,820 metric tons, and in two more years, by\\ntwo other vessels of still greater power and tonnage. In 1853 the\\nCunard Co., whose mail-carrying charter had just been renewed,\\nsuccessively added to its assets the Arabia, the Persia, the China,\\nthe Scotia, the Java, and the Russia, all ships of top speed and,\\nafter the Great Eastern, the biggest ever to plow the seas. So in 1867\\nthis company owned twelve ships, eight with paddle wheels and four\\nwith propellers.\\n\\nIf I give these highly condensed details, it is so everyone can fully\\nunderstand the importance of this maritime transportation company,\\nknown the world over for its shrewd management. No transoceanic\\nnavigational undertaking has been conducted with more ability, no\\nbusiness dealings have been crowned with greater success. In\\ntwenty-six years Cunard ships have made 2,000 Atlantic crossings\\nwithout so much as a voyage canceled, a delay recorded, a man, a\\ncraft, or even a letter lost. Accordingly, despite strong competition\\nfrom France, passengers still choose the Cunard line in preference to\\nall others, as can be seen in a recent survey of official\\ndocuments. Given this, no one will be astonished at the uproar\\nprovoked by this accident involving one of its finest steamers.\\n\\nOn April 13, 1867, with a smooth sea and a moderate breeze, the Scotia\\nlay in longitude 15 degrees 12’ and latitude 45 degrees 37’. It was\\ntraveling at a speed of 13.43 knots under the thrust of its\\n1,000-horsepower engines. Its paddle wheels were churning the sea with\\nperfect steadiness. It was then drawing 6.7 meters of water and\\ndisplacing 6,624 cubic meters.\\n\\nAt 4:17 in the afternoon, during a high tea for passengers gathered in\\nthe main lounge, a collision occurred, scarcely noticeable on the\\nwhole, affecting the Scotia’s hull in that quarter a little astern of\\nits port paddle wheel.\\n\\nThe Scotia hadn’t run afoul of something, it had been fouled, and by a\\ncutting or perforating instrument rather than a blunt one. This\\nencounter seemed so minor that nobody on board would have been\\ndisturbed by it, had it not been for the shouts of crewmen in the\\nhold, who climbed on deck yelling:\\n\\n“We’re sinking! We’re sinking!”\\n\\nAt first the passengers were quite frightened, but Captain Anderson\\nhastened to reassure them. In fact, there could be no immediate\\ndanger. Divided into seven compartments by watertight bulkheads, the\\nScotia could brave any leak with impunity.\\n\\nCaptain Anderson immediately made his way into the hold. He discovered\\nthat the fifth compartment had been invaded by the sea, and the speed\\nof this invasion proved that the leak was considerable. Fortunately\\nthis compartment didn’t contain the boilers, because their furnaces\\nwould have been abruptly extinguished.\\n\\nCaptain Anderson called an immediate halt, and one of his sailors\\ndived down to assess the damage. Within moments they had located a\\nhole two meters in width on the steamer’s underside. Such a leak could\\nnot be patched, and with its paddle wheels half swamped, the Scotia\\nhad no choice but to continue its voyage. By then it lay 300 miles\\nfrom Cape Clear, and after three days of delay that filled Liverpool\\nwith acute anxiety, it entered the company docks.\\n\\nThe engineers then proceeded to inspect the Scotia, which had been put\\nin dry dock. They couldn’t believe their eyes. Two and a half meters\\nbelow its waterline, there gaped a symmetrical gash in the shape of an\\nisosceles triangle. This breach in the sheet iron was so perfectly\\nformed, no punch could have done a cleaner job of it. Consequently, it\\nmust have been produced by a perforating tool of uncommon\\ntoughness—plus, after being launched with prodigious power and then\\npiercing four centimeters of sheet iron, this tool had needed to\\nwithdraw itself by a backward motion truly inexplicable.\\n\\nThis was the last straw, and it resulted in arousing public passions\\nall over again. Indeed, from this moment on, any maritime casualty\\nwithout an established cause was charged to the monster’s\\naccount. This outrageous animal had to shoulder responsibility for all\\nderelict vessels, whose numbers are unfortunately considerable, since\\nout of those 3,000 ships whose losses are recorded annually at the\\nmarine insurance bureau, the figure for steam or sailing ships\\nsupposedly lost with all hands, in the absence of any news, amounts to\\nat least 200!\\n\\nNow then, justly or unjustly, it was the “monster” who stood accused\\nof their disappearance; and since, thanks to it, travel between the\\nvarious continents had become more and more dangerous, the public\\nspoke up and demanded straight out that, at all cost, the seas be\\npurged of this fearsome cetacean.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nThe Pros and Cons\\n\\n\\nDURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring, I had\\nreturned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore the\\nNebraska badlands in the United States. In my capacity as Assistant\\nProfessor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had been attached\\nto this expedition by the French government. After spending six months\\nin Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden with valuable collections\\nnear the end of March. My departure for France was set for early\\nMay. In the meantime, then, I was busy classifying my mineralogical,\\nbotanical, and zoological treasures when that incident took place with\\nthe Scotia.\\n\\nI was perfectly abreast of this question, which was the big news of\\nthe day, and how could I not have been? I had read and reread every\\nAmerican and European newspaper without being any farther along. This\\nmystery puzzled me. Finding it impossible to form any views, I drifted\\nfrom one extreme to the other. Something was out there, that much was\\ncertain, and any doubting Thomas was invited to place his finger on\\nthe Scotia’s wound.\\n\\nWhen I arrived in New York, the question was at the boiling point. The\\nhypothesis of a drifting islet or an elusive reef, put forward by\\npeople not quite in their right minds, was completely eliminated. And\\nindeed, unless this reef had an engine in its belly, how could it move\\nabout with such prodigious speed?\\n\\nAlso discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other\\nenormous wreckage, and again because of this speed of movement.\\n\\nSo only two possible solutions to the question were left, creating two\\nvery distinct groups of supporters: on one side, those favoring a\\nmonster of colossal strength; on the other, those favoring an\\n“underwater boat” of tremendous motor power.\\n\\nNow then, although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible, it\\ncouldn’t stand up to inquiries conducted in both the New World and the\\nOld. That a private individual had such a mechanism at his disposal\\nwas less than probable. Where and when had he built it, and how could\\nhe have built it in secret?\\n\\nOnly some government could own such an engine of destruction, and in\\nthese disaster-filled times, when men tax their ingenuity to build\\nincreasingly powerful aggressive weapons, it was possible that,\\nunknown to the rest of the world, some nation could have been testing\\nsuch a fearsome machine. The Chassepot rifle led to the torpedo, and\\nthe torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram, which in turn\\nwill lead to the world putting its foot down. At least I hope it will.\\n\\nBut this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal\\ndenials from the various governments. Since the public interest was at\\nstake and transoceanic travel was suffering, the sincerity of these\\ngovernments could not be doubted. Besides, how could the assembly of\\nthis underwater boat have escaped public notice? Keeping a secret\\nunder such circumstances would be difficult enough for an individual,\\nand certainly impossible for a nation whose every move is under\\nconstant surveillance by rival powers.\\n\\nSo, after inquiries conducted in England, France, Russia, Prussia,\\nSpain, Italy, America, and even Turkey, the hypothesis of an\\nunderwater Monitor was ultimately rejected.\\n\\nAnd so the monster surfaced again, despite the endless witticisms\\nheaped on it by the popular press, and the human imagination soon got\\ncaught up in the most ridiculous ichthyological fantasies.\\n\\nAfter I arrived in New York, several people did me the honor of\\nconsulting me on the phenomenon in question. In France I had published\\na two-volume work, in quarto, entitled The Mysteries of the Great\\nOcean Depths. Well received in scholarly circles, this book had\\nestablished me as a specialist in this pretty obscure field of natural\\nhistory. My views were in demand. As long as I could deny the reality\\nof the business, I confined myself to a flat “no comment.” But soon,\\npinned to the wall, I had to explain myself straight out. And in this\\nvein, “the honorable Pierre Aronnax, Professor at the Paris Museum,”\\nwas summoned by The New York Herald to formulate his views no matter\\nwhat.\\n\\nI complied. Since I could no longer hold my tongue, I let it wag. I\\ndiscussed the question in its every aspect, both political and\\nscientific, and this is an excerpt from the well-padded article I\\npublished in the issue of April 30.\\n\\n“Therefore,” I wrote, “after examining these different hypotheses one\\nby one, we are forced, every other supposition having been refuted, to\\naccept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal.\\n\\n“The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us. No\\nsoundings have been able to reach them. What goes on in those distant\\ndepths? What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve\\nor fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? What is the\\nconstitution of these animals? It’s almost beyond conjecture.\\n\\n“However, the solution to this problem submitted to me can take the\\nform of a choice between two alternatives.\\n\\n“Either we know every variety of creature populating our planet, or we\\ndo not.\\n\\n“If we do not know every one of them, if nature still keeps\\nichthyological secrets from us, nothing is more admissible than to\\naccept the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new\\ngenera, animals with a basically ‘cast-iron’ constitution that inhabit\\nstrata beyond the reach of our soundings, and which some development\\nor other, an urge or a whim if you prefer, can bring to the upper\\nlevel of the ocean for long intervals.\\n\\n“If, on the other hand, we do know every living species, we must look\\nfor the animal in question among those marine creatures already\\ncataloged, and in this event I would be inclined to accept the\\nexistence of a giant narwhale.\\n\\n“The common narwhale, or sea unicorn, often reaches a length of sixty\\nfeet. Increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold, then give this\\ncetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging its\\noffensive weapons, and you have the animal we’re looking for. It would\\nhave the proportions determined by the officers of the Shannon, the\\ninstrument needed to perforate the Scotia, and the power to pierce a\\nsteamer’s hull.\\n\\n“In essence, the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword, or\\nlance, as certain naturalists have expressed it. It’s a king-sized\\ntooth as hard as steel. Some of these teeth have been found buried in\\nthe bodies of baleen whales, which the narwhale attacks with\\ninvariable success. Others have been wrenched, not without difficulty,\\nfrom the undersides of vessels that narwhales have pierced clean\\nthrough, as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel. The museum at the Faculty\\nof Medicine in Paris owns one of these tusks with a length of 2.25\\nmeters and a width at its base of forty-eight centimeters!\\n\\n“All right then! Imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and the\\nanimal ten times more powerful, launch it at a speed of twenty miles\\nper hour, multiply its mass times its velocity, and you get just the\\ncollision we need to cause the specified catastrophe.\\n\\n“So, until information becomes more abundant, I plump for a sea\\nunicorn of colossal dimensions, no longer armed with a mere lance but\\nwith an actual spur, like ironclad frigates or those warships called\\n‘rams,’ whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously.\\n\\n“This inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away—unless it’s\\nsomething else entirely, which, despite everything that has been\\nsighted, studied, explored and experienced, is still possible!”\\n\\nThese last words were cowardly of me; but as far as I could, I wanted\\nto protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open to laughter\\nfrom the Americans, who when they do laugh, laugh raucously. I had\\nleft myself a loophole. Yet deep down, I had accepted the existence of\\n“the monster.”\\n\\nMy article was hotly debated, causing a fine old uproar. It rallied a\\nnumber of supporters. Moreover, the solution it proposed allowed for\\nfree play of the imagination. The human mind enjoys impressive visions\\nof unearthly creatures. Now then, the sea is precisely their best\\nmedium, the only setting suitable for the breeding and growing of such\\ngiants—next to which such land animals as elephants or rhinoceroses\\nare mere dwarves. The liquid masses support the largest known species\\nof mammals and perhaps conceal mollusks of incomparable size or\\ncrustaceans too frightful to contemplate, such as 100-meter lobsters\\nor crabs weighing 200 metric tons! Why not? Formerly, in prehistoric\\ndays, land animals (quadrupeds, apes, reptiles, birds) were built on a\\ngigantic scale. Our Creator cast them using a colossal mold that time\\nhas gradually made smaller. With its untold depths, couldn’t the sea\\nkeep alive such huge specimens of life from another age, this sea that\\nnever changes while the land masses undergo almost continuous\\nalteration? Couldn’t the heart of the ocean hide the last-remaining\\nvarieties of these titanic species, for whom years are centuries and\\ncenturies millennia?\\n\\nBut I mustn’t let these fantasies run away with me! Enough of these\\nfairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities. I\\nrepeat: opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon,\\nand the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious\\ncreature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent.\\n\\nYet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved, more\\npractical people, especially in America and England, were determined\\nto purge the ocean of this daunting monster, to insure the safety of\\ntransoceanic travel. The industrial and commercial newspapers dealt\\nwith the question chiefly from this viewpoint. The Shipping &\\nMercantile Gazette, the Lloyd’s List, France’s Packetboat and Maritime\\n& Colonial Review, all the rags devoted to insurance companies—who\\nthreatened to raise their premium rates—were unanimous on this point.\\n\\nPublic opinion being pronounced, the States of the Union were the\\nfirst in the field. In New York preparations were under way for an\\nexpedition designed to chase this narwhale. A high-speed frigate, the\\nAbraham Lincoln, was fitted out for putting to sea as soon as\\npossible. The naval arsenals were unlocked for Commander Farragut, who\\npressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate.\\n\\nBut, as it always happens, just when a decision had been made to chase\\nthe monster, the monster put in no further appearances. For two months\\nnobody heard a word about it. Not a single ship encountered\\nit. Apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven\\naround it. People were constantly babbling about the creature, even\\nvia the Atlantic Cable! Accordingly, the wags claimed that this\\nslippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making the\\nmost of it.\\n\\nSo the frigate was equipped for a far-off voyage and armed with\\nfearsome fishing gear, but nobody knew where to steer it. And\\nimpatience grew until, on June 2, word came that the Tampico, a\\nsteamer on the San Francisco line sailing from California to Shanghai,\\nhad sighted the animal again, three weeks before in the northerly seas\\nof the Pacific.\\n\\nThis news caused intense excitement. Not even a 24-hour breather was\\ngranted to Commander Farragut. His provisions were loaded on\\nboard. His coal bunkers were overflowing. Not a crewman was missing\\nfrom his post. To cast off, he needed only to fire and stoke his\\nfurnaces! Half a day’s delay would have been unforgivable! But\\nCommander Farragut wanted nothing more than to go forth.\\n\\nI received a letter three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left its\\nBrooklyn pier;* the letter read as follows:\\n\\n*Author’s Note: A pier is a type of wharf expressly set aside for an\\n individual vessel.\\n\\n  Pierre Aronnax\\n  Professor at the Paris Museum\\n  Fifth Avenue Hotel\\n  New York\\n\\n  Sir:\\n\\n  If you would like to join the expedition on the Abraham Lincoln, the\\n  government of the Union will be pleased to regard you as France’s\\n  representative in this undertaking. Commander Farragut has a cabin at\\n  your disposal.\\n\\n  Very cordially yours,\\n\\n  J. B. HOBSON,\\n  Secretary of the Navy.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nAs Master Wishes\\n\\n\\nTHREE SECONDS before the arrival of J. B. Hobson’s letter, I no more\\ndreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for the Northwest\\nPassage. Three seconds after reading this letter from the honorable\\nSecretary of the Navy, I understood at last that my true vocation, my\\nsole purpose in life, was to hunt down this disturbing monster and rid\\nthe world of it.\\n\\nEven so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and\\nbadly needing a rest. I wanted nothing more than to see my country\\nagain, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my\\ndearly beloved collections! But now nothing could hold me back. I\\nforgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion,\\nfriends, or collections, I accepted the American government’s offer.\\n\\n“Besides,” I mused, “all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn\\nmay be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France! That\\nfine animal may even let itself be captured in European seas—as a\\npersonal favor to me—and I’ll bring back to the Museum of Natural\\nHistory at least half a meter of its ivory lance!”\\n\\nBut in the meantime I would have to look for this narwhale in the\\nnorthern Pacific Ocean; which meant returning to France by way of the\\nAntipodes.\\n\\n“Conseil!” I called in an impatient voice.\\n\\nConseil was my manservant. A devoted lad who went with me on all my\\njourneys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who\\nreturned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle,\\nhabitually hardworking, rarely startled by life’s surprises, very\\nskillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite his\\nhaving a name that means “counsel,” never giving advice—not even the\\nunsolicited kind!\\n\\nFrom rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the\\nBotanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two. In Conseil\\nI had a seasoned specialist in biological classification, an\\nenthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down the whole\\nladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses, orders, families,\\ngenera, subgenera, species, and varieties. But there his science came\\nto a halt. Classifying was everything to him, so he knew nothing\\nelse. Well versed in the theory of classification, he was poorly\\nversed in its practical application, and I doubt that he could tell a\\nsperm whale from a baleen whale! And yet, what a fine, gallant lad!\\n\\nFor the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever science\\nbeckoned. Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a\\njourney. Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any\\ncountry whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was. He\\nwent here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment. Moreover, he\\nenjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments, owned solid\\nmuscles, but hadn’t a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves—the mental\\ntype, I mean.\\n\\nThe lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer was\\nas fifteen is to twenty. Please forgive me for this underhanded way of\\nadmitting I had turned forty.\\n\\nBut Conseil had one flaw. He was a fanatic on formality, and he only\\naddressed me in the third person—to the point where it got tiresome.\\n\\n“Conseil!” I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations for\\ndeparture.\\n\\nTo be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad. Ordinarily, I never\\nasked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys; but\\nthis time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely,\\na hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could\\nsink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell! There was good reason to\\nstop and think, even for the world’s most emotionless man. What would\\nConseil say?\\n\\n“Conseil!” I called a third time.\\n\\nConseil appeared.\\n\\n“Did master summon me?” he said, entering.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy. Get my things ready, get yours ready. We’re departing in\\ntwo hours.”\\n\\n“As master wishes,” Conseil replied serenely.\\n\\n“We haven’t a moment to lose. Pack as much into my trunk as you can,\\nmy traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don’t bother counting,\\njust squeeze it all in—and hurry!”\\n\\n“What about master’s collections?” Conseil ventured to observe.\\n\\n“We’ll deal with them later.”\\n\\n“What! The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus,\\nand master’s other fossil skeletons?”\\n\\n“The hotel will keep them for us.”\\n\\n“What about master’s live babirusa?”\\n\\n“They’ll feed it during our absence. Anyhow, we’ll leave instructions\\nto ship the whole menagerie to France.”\\n\\n“Then we aren’t returning to Paris?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ,” I replied evasively, “but after\\nwe make a detour.”\\n\\n“Whatever detour master wishes.”\\n\\n“Oh, it’s nothing really! A route slightly less direct, that’s\\nall. We’re leaving on the Abraham Lincoln.”\\n\\n“As master thinks best,” Conseil replied placidly.\\n\\n“You see, my friend, it’s an issue of the monster, the notorious\\nnarwhale. We’re going to rid the seas of it! The author of a\\ntwo-volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries of the Great Ocean Depths\\nhas no excuse for not setting sail with Commander Farragut. It’s a\\nglorious mission but also a dangerous one! We don’t know where it will\\ntake us! These beasts can be quite unpredictable! But we’re going just\\nthe same! We have a commander who’s game for anything!”\\n\\n“What master does, I’ll do,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“But think it over, because I don’t want to hide anything from\\nyou. This is one of those voyages from which people don’t always come\\nback!”\\n\\n“As master wishes.”\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready. Conseil did them in\\na flash, and I was sure the lad hadn’t missed a thing, because he\\nclassified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.\\n\\nThe hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the\\nmezzanine. I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor. I\\nsettled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege by a\\nconsiderable crowd. I left instructions for shipping my containers of\\nstuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France. I opened a line of\\ncredit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels, I\\njumped into a carriage.\\n\\nFor a fare of twenty francs, the vehicle went down Broadway to Union\\nSquare, took Fourth Ave. to its junction with Bowery St., turned into\\nKatrin St. and halted at Pier 34. There the Katrin ferry transferred\\nmen, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York annex\\nlocated on the left bank of the East River, and in a few minutes we\\narrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln was vomiting\\ntorrents of black smoke from its two funnels.\\n\\nOur baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I\\nrushed aboard. I asked for Commander Farragut. One of the sailors led\\nme to the afterdeck, where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking\\nofficer who extended his hand to me.\\n\\n“Professor Pierre Aronnax?” he said to me.\\n\\n“The same,” I replied. “Commander Farragut?”\\n\\n“In person. Welcome aboard, professor. Your cabin is waiting for you.”\\n\\nI bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way, I was\\ntaken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.\\n\\nThe Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out for its\\nnew assignment. It was a high-speed frigate furnished with\\nsuperheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build\\nto seven atmospheres. Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln reached\\nan average speed of 18.3 miles per hour, a considerable speed but\\nstill not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.\\n\\nThe frigate’s interior accommodations complemented its nautical\\nvirtues. I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the\\nstern and opened into the officers’ mess.\\n\\n“We’ll be quite comfortable here,” I told Conseil.\\n\\n“With all due respect to master,” Conseil replied, “as comfortable as\\na hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk.”\\n\\nI left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed on\\ndeck to watch the preparations for getting under way.\\n\\nJust then Commander Farragut was giving orders to cast off the last\\nmoorings holding the Abraham Lincoln to its Brooklyn pier. And so if\\nI’d been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less, the frigate\\nwould have gone without me, and I would have missed out on this\\nunearthly, extraordinary, and inconceivable expedition, whose true\\nstory might well meet with some skepticism.\\n\\nBut Commander Farragut didn’t want to waste a single day, or even a\\nsingle hour, in making for those seas where the animal had just been\\nsighted. He summoned his engineer.\\n\\n“Are we up to pressure?” he asked the man.\\n\\n“Aye, sir,” the engineer replied.\\n\\n“Go ahead, then!” Commander Farragut called.\\n\\nAt this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a\\ncompressed-air device, the mechanics activated the start-up\\nwheel. Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves. Long horizontal\\npistons groaned and pushed the tie rods of the drive shaft. The blades\\nof the propeller churned the waves with increasing speed, and the\\nAbraham Lincoln moved out majestically amid a spectator-laden escort\\nof some 100 ferries and tenders.*\\n\\n*Author’s Note: Tenders are small steamboats that assist the big\\n liners.\\n\\nThe wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering the East\\nRiver, were crowded with curiosity seekers. Departing from 500,000\\nthroats, three cheers burst forth in succession. Thousands of\\nhandkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses, hailing\\nthe Abraham\\n\\nLincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip of\\nthe long peninsula that forms New York City.\\n\\nThe frigate then went along the New Jersey coast—the wonderful right\\nbank of this river, all loaded down with country homes—and passed by\\nthe forts to salutes from their biggest cannons. The Abraham Lincoln\\nreplied by three times lowering and hoisting the American flag, whose\\nthirty-nine stars gleamed from the gaff of the mizzen sail; then,\\nchanging speed to take the buoy-marked channel that curved into the\\ninner bay formed by the spit of Sandy Hook, it hugged this\\nsand-covered strip of land where thousands of spectators acclaimed us\\none more time.\\n\\nThe escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only\\nleft us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal lights\\nmark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.\\n\\nThree o’clock then sounded. The harbor pilot went down into his dinghy\\nand rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward. The\\nfurnaces were stoked; the propeller churned the waves more swiftly;\\nthe frigate skirted the flat, yellow coast of Long Island; and at\\neight o’clock in the evening, after the lights of Fire Island had\\nvanished into the northwest, we ran at full steam onto the dark waters\\nof the Atlantic.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nNed Land\\n\\n\\nCOMMANDER FARRAGUT was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he\\ncommanded. His ship and he were one. He was its very soul. On the\\ncetacean question no doubts arose in his mind, and he didn’t allow the\\nanimal’s existence to be disputed aboard his vessel. He believed in it\\nas certain pious women believe in the leviathan from the Book of\\nJob—out of faith, not reason. The monster existed, and he had vowed to\\nrid the seas of it. The man was a sort of Knight of Rhodes, a\\nlatter-day Sir Dieudonné of Gozo, on his way to fight an encounter\\nwith the dragon devastating the island. Either Commander Farragut\\nwould slay the narwhale, or the narwhale would slay Commander\\nFarragut. No middle of the road for these two.\\n\\nThe ship’s officers shared the views of their leader. They could be\\nheard chatting, discussing, arguing, calculating the different chances\\nof an encounter, and observing the vast expanse of the\\nocean. Voluntary watches from the crosstrees of the topgallant sail\\nwere self-imposed by more than one who would have cursed such toil\\nunder any other circumstances. As often as the sun swept over its\\ndaily arc, the masts were populated with sailors whose feet itched and\\ncouldn’t hold still on the planking of the deck below! And the Abraham\\nLincoln’s stempost hadn’t even cut the suspected waters of the\\nPacific.\\n\\nAs for the crew, they only wanted to encounter the unicorn, harpoon\\nit, haul it on board, and carve it up. They surveyed the sea with\\nscrupulous care. Besides, Commander Farragut had mentioned that a\\ncertain sum of $2,000.00 was waiting for the man who first sighted the\\nanimal, be he cabin boy or sailor, mate or officer. I’ll let the\\nreader decide whether eyes got proper exercise aboard the Abraham\\nLincoln.\\n\\nAs for me, I didn’t lag behind the others and I yielded to no one my\\nshare in these daily observations. Our frigate would have had\\nfivescore good reasons for renaming itself the Argus, after that\\nmythological beast with 100 eyes! The lone rebel among us was Conseil,\\nwho seemed utterly uninterested in the question exciting us and was\\nout of step with the general enthusiasm on board.\\n\\nAs I said, Commander Farragut had carefully equipped his ship with all\\nthe gear needed to fish for a gigantic cetacean. No whaling vessel\\ncould have been better armed. We had every known mechanism, from the\\nhand-hurled harpoon, to the blunderbuss firing barbed arrows, to the\\nduck gun with exploding bullets. On the forecastle was mounted the\\nlatest model breech-loading cannon, very heavy of barrel and narrow of\\nbore, a weapon that would figure in the Universal Exhibition of\\n1867. Made in America, this valuable instrument could fire a\\nfour-kilogram conical projectile an average distance of sixteen\\nkilometers without the least bother.\\n\\nSo the Abraham Lincoln wasn’t lacking in means of destruction. But it\\nhad better still. It had Ned Land, the King of Harpooners.\\n\\nGifted with uncommon manual ability, Ned Land was a Canadian who had\\nno equal in his dangerous trade. Dexterity, coolness, bravery, and\\ncunning were virtues he possessed to a high degree, and it took a\\ntruly crafty baleen whale or an exceptionally astute sperm whale to\\nelude the thrusts of his harpoon.\\n\\nNed Land was about forty years old. A man of great height—over six\\nEnglish feet—he was powerfully built, serious in manner, not very\\nsociable, sometimes headstrong, and quite ill-tempered when\\ncrossed. His looks caught the attention, and above all the strength of\\nhis gaze, which gave a unique emphasis to his facial appearance.\\n\\nCommander Farragut, to my thinking, had made a wise move in hiring on\\nthis man. With his eye and his throwing arm, he was worth the whole\\ncrew all by himself. I can do no better than to compare him with a\\npowerful telescope that could double as a cannon always ready to fire.\\n\\nTo say Canadian is to say French, and as unsociable as Ned Land was, I\\nmust admit he took a definite liking to me. No doubt it was my\\nnationality that attracted him. It was an opportunity for him to\\nspeak, and for me to hear, that old Rabelaisian dialect still used in\\nsome Canadian provinces. The harpooner’s family originated in Quebec,\\nand they were already a line of bold fishermen back in the days when\\nthis town still belonged to France.\\n\\nLittle by little Ned developed a taste for chatting, and I loved\\nhearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas. He described\\nhis fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism. His\\ntales took on the form of an epic poem, and I felt I was hearing some\\nCanadian Homer reciting his Iliad of the High Arctic regions.\\n\\nI’m writing of this bold companion as I currently know him. Because\\nwe’ve become old friends, united in that permanent comradeship born\\nand cemented during only the most frightful crises! Ah, my gallant\\nNed! I ask only to live 100 years more, the longer to remember you!\\n\\nAnd now, what were Ned Land’s views on this question of a marine\\nmonster? I must admit that he flatly didn’t believe in the unicorn,\\nand alone on board, he didn’t share the general conviction. He avoided\\neven dealing with the subject, for which one day I felt compelled to\\ntake him to task.\\n\\nDuring the magnificent evening of June 25—in other words, three weeks\\nafter our departure—the frigate lay abreast of Cabo Blanco, thirty\\nmiles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia. We had crossed the Tropic\\nof Capricorn, and the Strait of Magellan opened less than 700 miles to\\nthe south. Before eight days were out, the Abraham Lincoln would plow\\nthe waves of the Pacific.\\n\\nSeated on the afterdeck, Ned Land and I chatted about one thing and\\nanother, staring at that mysterious sea whose depths to this day are\\nbeyond the reach of human eyes. Quite naturally, I led our\\nconversation around to the giant unicorn, and I weighed our\\nexpedition’s various chances for success or failure. Then, seeing that\\nNed just let me talk without saying much himself, I pressed him more\\nclosely.\\n\\n“Ned,” I asked him, “how can you still doubt the reality of this\\ncetacean we’re after? Do you have any particular reasons for being so\\nskeptical?”\\n\\nThe harpooner stared at me awhile before replying, slapped his broad\\nforehead in one of his standard gestures, closed his eyes as if to\\ncollect himself, and finally said:\\n\\n“Just maybe, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“But Ned, you’re a professional whaler, a man familiar with all the\\ngreat marine mammals—your mind should easily accept this hypothesis of\\nan enormous cetacean, and you ought to be the last one to doubt it\\nunder these circumstances!”\\n\\n“That’s just where you’re mistaken, professor,” Ned replied. “The\\ncommon man may still believe in fabulous comets crossing outer space,\\nor in prehistoric monsters living at the earth’s core, but astronomers\\nand geologists don’t swallow such fairy tales. It’s the same with\\nwhalers. I’ve chased plenty of cetaceans, I’ve harpooned a good\\nnumber, I’ve killed several. But no matter how powerful and well armed\\nthey were, neither their tails or their tusks could puncture the\\nsheet-iron plates of a steamer.”\\n\\n“Even so, Ned, people mention vessels that narwhale tusks have run\\nclean through.”\\n\\n“Wooden ships maybe,” the Canadian replied. “But I’ve never seen the\\nlike. So till I have proof to the contrary, I’ll deny that baleen\\nwhales, sperm whales, or unicorns can do any such thing.”\\n\\n“Listen to me, Ned—”\\n\\n“No, no, professor. I’ll go along with anything you want except\\nthat. Some gigantic devilfish maybe . . . ?”\\n\\n“Even less likely, Ned. The devilfish is merely a mollusk, and even\\nthis name hints at its semiliquid flesh, because it’s Latin meaning\\nsoft one. The devilfish doesn’t belong to the vertebrate branch, and\\neven if it were 500 feet long, it would still be utterly harmless to\\nships like the Scotia or the Abraham Lincoln. Consequently, the feats\\nof krakens or other monsters of that ilk must be relegated to the\\nrealm of fiction.”\\n\\n“So, Mr. Naturalist,” Ned Land continued in a bantering tone, “you’ll\\njust keep on believing in the existence of some enormous cetacean\\n. . . ?”\\n\\n“Yes, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction backed by factual logic. I\\nbelieve in the existence of a mammal with a powerful constitution,\\nbelonging to the vertebrate branch like baleen whales, sperm whales,\\nor dolphins, and armed with a tusk made of horn that has tremendous\\npenetrating power.”\\n\\n“Humph!” the harpooner put in, shaking his head with the attitude of a\\nman who doesn’t want to be convinced.\\n\\n“Note well, my fine Canadian,” I went on, “if such an animal exists,\\nif it lives deep in the ocean, if it frequents the liquid strata\\nlocated miles beneath the surface of the water, it needs to have a\\nconstitution so solid, it defies all comparison.”\\n\\n“And why this powerful constitution?” Ned asked.\\n\\n“Because it takes incalculable strength just to live in those deep\\nstrata and withstand their pressure.”\\n\\n“Oh really?” Ned said, tipping me a wink.\\n\\n“Oh really, and I can prove it to you with a few simple figures.”\\n\\n“Bosh!” Ned replied. “You can make figures do anything you want!”\\n\\n“In business, Ned, but not in mathematics. Listen to me. Let’s accept\\nthat the pressure of one atmosphere is represented by the pressure of\\na column of water thirty-two feet high. In reality, such a column of\\nwater wouldn’t be quite so high because here we’re dealing with salt\\nwater, which is denser than fresh water. Well then, when you dive\\nunder the waves, Ned, for every thirty-two feet of water above you,\\nyour body is tolerating the pressure of one more atmosphere, in other\\nwords, one more kilogram per each square centimeter on your body’s\\nsurface. So it follows that at 320 feet down, this pressure is equal\\nto ten atmospheres, to 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and to 1,000\\natmospheres at 32,000 feet, that is, at about two and a half vertical\\nleagues down. Which is tantamount to saying that if you could reach\\nsuch a depth in the ocean, each square centimeter on your body’s\\nsurface would be experiencing 1,000 kilograms of pressure. Now, my\\ngallant Ned, do you know how many square centimeters you have on your\\nbodily surface?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the foggiest notion, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“About 17,000.”\\n\\n“As many as that?”\\n\\n“Yes, and since the atmosphere’s pressure actually weighs slightly\\nmore than one kilogram per square centimeter, your 17,000 square\\ncentimeters are tolerating 17,568 kilograms at this very moment.”\\n\\n“Without my noticing it?”\\n\\n“Without your noticing it. And if you aren’t crushed by so much\\npressure, it’s because the air penetrates the interior of your body\\nwith equal pressure. When the inside and outside pressures are in\\nperfect balance, they neutralize each other and allow you to tolerate\\nthem without discomfort. But in the water it’s another story.”\\n\\n“Yes, I see,” Ned replied, growing more interested. “Because the water\\nsurrounds me but doesn’t penetrate me.”\\n\\n“Precisely, Ned. So at thirty-two feet beneath the surface of the sea,\\nyou’ll undergo a pressure of 17,568 kilograms; at 320 feet, or ten\\ntimes greater pressure, it’s 175,680 kilograms; at 3,200 feet, or 100\\ntimes greater pressure, it’s 1,756,800 kilograms; finally, at 32,000\\nfeet, or 1,000 times greater pressure, it’s 17,568,000 kilograms; in\\nother words, you’d be squashed as flat as if you’d just been yanked\\nfrom between the plates of a hydraulic press!”\\n\\n“Fire and brimstone!” Ned put in.\\n\\n“All right then, my fine harpooner, if vertebrates several hundred\\nmeters long and proportionate in bulk live at such depths, their\\nsurface areas make up millions of square centimeters, and the pressure\\nthey undergo must be assessed in billions of kilograms. Calculate,\\nthen, how much resistance of bone structure and strength of\\nconstitution they’d need in order to withstand such pressures!”\\n\\n“They’d need to be manufactured,” Ned Land replied, “from sheet-iron\\nplates eight inches thick, like ironclad frigates.”\\n\\n“Right, Ned, and then picture the damage such a mass could inflict if\\nit were launched with the speed of an express train against a ship’s\\nhull.”\\n\\n“Yes . . . indeed . . . maybe,” the Canadian replied, staggered by\\nthese figures but still not willing to give in.\\n\\n“Well, have I convinced you?”\\n\\n“You’ve convinced me of one thing, Mr. Naturalist. That deep in the\\nsea, such animals would need to be just as strong as you say—if they\\nexist.”\\n\\n“But if they don’t exist, my stubborn harpooner, how do you explain\\nthe accident that happened to the Scotia?”\\n\\n“It’s maybe . . . ,” Ned said, hesitating.\\n\\n“Go on!”\\n\\n“Because . . . it just couldn’t be true!” the Canadian replied,\\nunconsciously echoing a famous catchphrase of the scientist Arago.\\n\\nBut this reply proved nothing, other than how bullheaded the harpooner\\ncould be. That day I pressed him no further. The Scotia’s accident was\\nundeniable. Its hole was real enough that it had to be plugged up, and\\nI don’t think a hole’s existence can be more emphatically proven. Now\\nthen, this hole didn’t make itself, and since it hadn’t resulted from\\nunderwater rocks or underwater machines, it must have been caused by\\nthe perforating tool of some animal.\\n\\nNow, for all the reasons put forward to this point, I believed that\\nthis animal was a member of the branch Vertebrata, class Mammalia,\\ngroup Pisciforma, and finally, order Cetacea. As for the family in\\nwhich it would be placed (baleen whale, sperm whale, or dolphin), the\\ngenus to which it belonged, and the species in which it would find its\\nproper home, these questions had to be left for later. To answer them\\ncalled for dissecting this unknown monster; to dissect it called for\\ncatching it; to catch it called for harpooning it—which was Ned Land’s\\nbusiness; to harpoon it called for sighting it—which was the crew’s\\nbusiness; and to sight it called for encountering it—which was a\\nchancy business.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nAt Random!\\n\\n\\nFOR SOME WHILE the voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was marked by no\\nincident. But one circumstance arose that displayed Ned Land’s\\nmarvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could place in\\nhim.\\n\\nOff the Falkland Islands on June 30, the frigate came in contact with\\na fleet of American whalers, and we learned that they hadn’t seen the\\nnarwhale. But one of them, the captain of the Monroe, knew that Ned\\nLand had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln and asked his help in\\nhunting a baleen whale that was in sight. Anxious to see Ned Land at\\nwork, Commander Farragut authorized him to make his way aboard the\\nMonroe. And the Canadian had such good luck that with a right-and-left\\nshot, he harpooned not one whale but two, striking the first straight\\nto the heart and catching the other after a few minutes’ chase!\\n\\nAssuredly, if the monster ever had to deal with Ned Land’s harpoon, I\\nwouldn’t bet on the monster.\\n\\nThe frigate sailed along the east coast of South America with\\nprodigious speed. By July 3 we were at the entrance to the Strait of\\nMagellan, abreast of Cabo de las Virgenes. But Commander Farragut was\\nunwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered instead\\nto double Cape Horn.\\n\\nThe crew sided with him unanimously. Indeed, were we likely to\\nencounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait? Many of our sailors\\nswore that the monster couldn’t negotiate this passageway simply\\nbecause “he’s too big for it!”\\n\\nNear three o’clock in the afternoon on July 6, fifteen miles south of\\nshore, the Abraham Lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip of\\nthe South American continent, that stray rock Dutch seamen had named\\nCape Horn after their hometown of Hoorn. Our course was set for the\\nnorthwest, and the next day our frigate’s propeller finally churned\\nthe waters of the Pacific.\\n\\n“Open your eyes! Open your eyes!” repeated the sailors of the Abraham\\nLincoln.\\n\\nAnd they opened amazingly wide. Eyes and spyglasses (a bit dazzled, it\\nis true, by the vista of $2,000.00) didn’t remain at rest for an\\ninstant. Day and night we observed the surface of the ocean, and those\\nwith nyctalopic eyes, whose ability to see in the dark increased their\\nchances by fifty percent, had an excellent shot at winning the prize.\\n\\nAs for me, I was hardly drawn by the lure of money and yet was far\\nfrom the least attentive on board. Snatching only a few minutes for\\nmeals and a few hours for sleep, come rain or come shine, I no longer\\nleft the ship’s deck. Sometimes bending over the forecastle railings,\\nsometimes leaning against the sternrail, I eagerly scoured that\\ncotton-colored wake that whitened the ocean as far as the eye could\\nsee! And how many times I shared the excitement of general staff and\\ncrew when some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the\\nwaves. In an instant the frigate’s deck would become densely\\npopulated. The cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of\\nsailors and officers. With panting chests and anxious eyes, we each\\nwould observe the cetacean’s movements. I stared; I stared until I\\nnearly went blind from a worn-out retina, while Conseil, as stoic as\\never, kept repeating to me in a calm tone:\\n\\n“If master’s eyes would kindly stop bulging, master will see farther!”\\n\\nBut what a waste of energy! The Abraham Lincoln would change course\\nand race after the animal sighted, only to find an ordinary baleen\\nwhale or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid a chorus of\\ncurses!\\n\\nHowever, the weather held good. Our voyage was proceeding under the\\nmost favorable conditions. By then it was the bad season in these\\nsouthernmost regions, because July in this zone corresponds to our\\nJanuary in Europe; but the sea remained smooth and easily visible over\\na vast perimeter.\\n\\nNed Land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism; beyond his\\nspells on watch, he pretended that he never even looked at the surface\\nof the waves, at least while no whales were in sight. And yet the\\nmarvelous power of his vision could have performed yeoman service. But\\nthis stubborn Canadian spent eight hours out of every twelve reading\\nor sleeping in his cabin. A hundred times I chided him for his\\nunconcern.\\n\\n“Bah!” he replied. “Nothing’s out there, Professor Aronnax, and if\\nthere is some animal, what chance would we have of spotting it? Can’t\\nyou see we’re just wandering around at random? People say they’ve\\nsighted this slippery beast again in the Pacific high seas—I’m truly\\nwilling to believe it, but two months have already gone by since then,\\nand judging by your narwhale’s personality, it hates growing moldy\\nfrom hanging out too long in the same waterways! It’s blessed with a\\nterrific gift for getting around. Now, professor, you know even better\\nthan I that nature doesn’t violate good sense, and she wouldn’t give\\nsome naturally slow animal the ability to move swiftly if it hadn’t a\\nneed to use that talent. So if the beast does exist, it’s already long\\ngone!”\\n\\nI had no reply to this. Obviously we were just groping blindly. But\\nhow else could we go about it? All the same, our chances were\\nautomatically pretty limited. Yet everyone still felt confident of\\nsuccess, and not a sailor on board would have bet against the narwhale\\nappearing, and soon.\\n\\nOn July 20 we cut the Tropic of Capricorn at longitude 105 degrees,\\nand by the 27th of the same month, we had cleared the equator on the\\n110th meridian. These bearings determined, the frigate took a more\\ndecisive westward heading and tackled the seas of the central\\nPacific. Commander Farragut felt, and with good reason, that it was\\nbest to stay in deep waters and keep his distance from continents or\\nislands, whose neighborhoods the animal always seemed to avoid—“No\\ndoubt,” our bosun said, “because there isn’t enough water for him!” So\\nthe frigate kept well out when passing the Tuamotu, Marquesas, and\\nHawaiian Islands, then cut the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 132\\ndegrees and headed for the seas of China.\\n\\nWe were finally in the area of the monster’s latest antics! And in all\\nhonesty, shipboard conditions became life-threatening. Hearts were\\npounding hideously, gearing up for futures full of incurable\\naneurysms. The entire crew suffered from a nervous excitement that\\nit’s beyond me to describe. Nobody ate, nobody slept. Twenty times a\\nday some error in perception, or the optical illusions of some sailor\\nperched in the crosstrees, would cause intolerable anguish, and this\\nemotion, repeated twenty times over, kept us in a state of\\nirritability so intense that a reaction was bound to follow.\\n\\nAnd this reaction wasn’t long in coming. For three months, during\\nwhich each day seemed like a century, the Abraham Lincoln plowed all\\nthe northerly seas of the Pacific, racing after whales sighted,\\nabruptly veering off course, swerving sharply from one tack to\\nanother, stopping suddenly, putting on steam and reversing engines in\\nquick succession, at the risk of stripping its gears, and it didn’t\\nleave a single point unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the\\ncoasts of America. And we found nothing! Nothing except an immenseness\\nof deserted waves! Nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale, or\\nan underwater islet, or a derelict shipwreck, or a runaway reef, or\\nanything the least bit unearthly!\\n\\nSo the reaction set in. At first, discouragement took hold of people’s\\nminds, opening the door to disbelief. A new feeling appeared on board,\\nmade up of three-tenths shame and seven-tenths fury. The crew called\\nthemselves “out-and-out fools” for being hoodwinked by a fairy tale,\\nthen grew steadily more furious! The mountains of arguments amassed\\nover a year collapsed all at once, and each man now wanted only to\\ncatch up on his eating and sleeping, to make up for the time he had so\\nstupidly sacrificed.\\n\\nWith typical human fickleness, they jumped from one extreme to the\\nother. Inevitably, the most enthusiastic supporters of the undertaking\\nbecame its most energetic opponents. This reaction mounted upward from\\nthe bowels of the ship, from the quarters of the bunker hands to the\\nmessroom of the general staff; and for certain, if it hadn’t been for\\nCommander Farragut’s characteristic stubbornness, the frigate would\\nultimately have put back to that cape in the south.\\n\\nBut this futile search couldn’t drag on much longer. The Abraham\\nLincoln had done everything it could to succeed and had no reason to\\nblame itself. Never had the crew of an American naval craft shown more\\npatience and zeal; they weren’t responsible for this failure; there\\nwas nothing to do but go home.\\n\\nA request to this effect was presented to the commander. The commander\\nstood his ground. His sailors couldn’t hide their discontent, and\\ntheir work suffered because of it. I’m unwilling to say that there was\\nmutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of intransigence,\\nCommander Farragut, like Christopher Columbus before him, asked for a\\ngrace period of just three days more. After this three-day delay, if\\nthe monster hadn’t appeared, our helmsman would give three turns of\\nthe wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would chart a course toward\\nEuropean seas.\\n\\nThis promise was given on November 2. It had the immediate effect of\\nreviving the crew’s failing spirits. The ocean was observed with\\nrenewed care. Each man wanted one last look with which to sum up his\\nexperience. Spyglasses functioned with feverish energy. A supreme\\nchallenge had been issued to the giant narwhale, and the latter had no\\nacceptable excuse for ignoring this Summons to Appear!\\n\\nTwo days passed. The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam. On the\\noffchance that the animal might be found in these waterways, a\\nthousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it from its\\napathy. Enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake, to the great\\nsatisfaction, I must say, of assorted sharks. While the Abraham\\nLincoln heaved to, its longboats radiated in every direction around it\\nand didn’t leave a single point of the sea unexplored. But the evening\\nof November 4 arrived with this underwater mystery still unsolved.\\n\\nAt noon the next day, November 5, the agreed-upon delay expired. After\\na position fix, true to his promise, Commander Farragut would have to\\nset his course for the southeast and leave the northerly regions of\\nthe Pacific decisively behind.\\n\\nBy then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15’ north and longitude\\n136 degrees 42’ east. The shores of Japan were less than 200 miles to\\nour leeward. Night was coming on. Eight o’clock had just struck. Huge\\nclouds covered the moon’s disk, then in its first quarter. The sea\\nundulated placidly beneath the frigate’s stempost.\\n\\nJust then I was in the bow, leaning over the starboard rail. Conseil,\\nstationed beside me, stared straight ahead. Roosting in the shrouds,\\nthe crew examined the horizon, which shrank and darkened little by\\nlittle. Officers were probing the increasing gloom with their night\\nglasses. Sometimes the murky ocean sparkled beneath moonbeams that\\ndarted between the fringes of two clouds. Then all traces of light\\nvanished into the darkness.\\n\\nObserving Conseil, I discovered that, just barely, the gallant lad had\\nfallen under the general influence. At least so I thought. Perhaps his\\nnerves were twitching with curiosity for the first time in history.\\n\\n“Come on, Conseil!” I told him. “Here’s your last chance to pocket\\nthat $2,000.00!”\\n\\n“If master will permit my saying so,” Conseil replied, “I never\\nexpected to win that prize, and the Union government could have\\npromised $100,000.00 and been none the poorer.”\\n\\n“You’re right, Conseil, it turned out to be a foolish business after\\nall, and we jumped into it too hastily. What a waste of time, what a\\nfutile expense of emotion! Six months ago we could have been back in\\nFrance—”\\n\\n“In master’s little apartment,” Conseil answered. “In master’s museum!\\nAnd by now I would have classified master’s fossils. And master’s\\nbabirusa would be ensconced in its cage at the zoo in the Botanical\\nGardens, and it would have attracted every curiosity seeker in town!”\\n\\n“Quite so, Conseil, and what’s more, I imagine that people will soon\\nbe poking fun at us!”\\n\\n“To be sure,” Conseil replied serenely, “I do think they’ll have fun\\nat master’s expense. And must it be said . . . ?”\\n\\n“It must be said, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Well then, it will serve master right!”\\n\\n“How true!”\\n\\n“When one has the honor of being an expert as master is, one mustn’t\\nlay himself open to—”\\n\\nConseil didn’t have time to complete the compliment. In the midst of\\nthe general silence, a voice became audible. It was Ned Land’s voice,\\nand it shouted:\\n\\n“Ahoy! There’s the thing in question, abreast of us to leeward!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nAt Full Steam\\n\\n\\nAT THIS SHOUT the entire crew rushed toward the harpooner—commander,\\nofficers, mates, sailors, cabin boys, down to engineers leaving their\\nmachinery and stokers neglecting their furnaces. The order was given\\nto stop, and the frigate merely coasted.\\n\\nBy then the darkness was profound, and as good as the Canadian’s eyes\\nwere, I still wondered how he could see—and what he had seen. My heart\\nwas pounding fit to burst.\\n\\nBut Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all spotted the object his hand\\nwas indicating.\\n\\nTwo cable lengths off the Abraham Lincoln’s starboard quarter, the sea\\nseemed to be lit up from underneath. This was no mere phosphorescent\\nphenomenon, that much was unmistakable. Submerged some fathoms below\\nthe surface of the water, the monster gave off that very intense but\\ninexplicable glow that several captains had mentioned in their\\nreports. This magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a\\ngreat illuminating capacity. The edge of its light swept over the sea\\nin an immense, highly elongated oval, condensing at the center into a\\nblazing core whose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward.\\n\\n“It’s only a cluster of phosphorescent particles!” exclaimed one of\\nthe officers.\\n\\n“No, sir,” I answered with conviction. “Not even angel-wing clams or\\nsalps have ever given off such a powerful light. That glow is\\nbasically electric in nature. Besides . . . look, look! It’s shifting!\\nIt’s moving back and forth! It’s darting at us!”\\n\\nA universal shout went up from the frigate.\\n\\n“Quiet!” Commander Farragut said. “Helm hard to leeward! Reverse\\nengines!”\\n\\nSailors rushed to the helm, engineers to their machinery. Under\\nreverse steam immediately, the Abraham Lincoln beat to port, sweeping\\nin a semicircle.\\n\\n“Right your helm! Engines forward!” Commander Farragut called.\\n\\nThese orders were executed, and the frigate swiftly retreated from\\nthis core of light.\\n\\nMy mistake. It wanted to retreat, but the unearthly animal came at us\\nwith a speed double our own.\\n\\nWe gasped. More stunned than afraid, we stood mute and motionless. The\\nanimal caught up with us, played with us. It made a full circle around\\nthe frigate—then doing fourteen knots—and wrapped us in sheets of\\nelectricity that were like luminous dust. Then it retreated two or\\nthree miles, leaving a phosphorescent trail comparable to those swirls\\nof steam that shoot behind the locomotive of an express\\ntrain. Suddenly, all the way from the dark horizon where it had gone\\nto gather momentum, the monster abruptly dashed toward the Abraham\\nLincoln with frightening speed, stopped sharply twenty feet from our\\nside plates, and died out—not by diving under the water, since its\\nglow did not recede gradually—but all at once, as if the source of\\nthis brilliant emanation had suddenly dried up. Then it reappeared on\\nthe other side of the ship, either by circling around us or by gliding\\nunder our hull. At any instant a collision could have occurred that\\nwould have been fatal to us.\\n\\nMeanwhile I was astonished at the frigate’s maneuvers. It was fleeing,\\nnot fighting. Built to pursue, it was being pursued, and I commented\\non this to Commander Farragut. His face, ordinarily so emotionless,\\nwas stamped with indescribable astonishment.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he answered me, “I don’t know what kind of\\nfearsome creature I’m up against, and I don’t want my frigate running\\nfoolish risks in all this darkness. Besides, how should we attack this\\nunknown creature, how should we defend ourselves against it? Let’s\\nwait for daylight, and then we’ll play a different role.”\\n\\n“You’ve no further doubts, commander, as to the nature of this\\nanimal?”\\n\\n“No, sir, it’s apparently a gigantic narwhale, and an electric one to\\nboot.”\\n\\n“Maybe,” I added, “it’s no more approachable than an electric eel or\\nan electric ray!”\\n\\n“Right,” the commander replied. “And if it has their power to\\nelectrocute, it’s surely the most dreadful animal ever conceived by\\nour Creator. That’s why I’ll keep on my guard, sir.”\\n\\nThe whole crew stayed on their feet all night long. No one even\\nthought of sleeping. Unable to compete with the monster’s speed, the\\nAbraham Lincoln slowed down and stayed at half steam. For its part,\\nthe narwhale mimicked the frigate, simply rode with the waves, and\\nseemed determined not to forsake the field of battle.\\n\\nHowever, near midnight it disappeared, or to use a more appropriate\\nexpression, “it went out,” like a huge glowworm. Had it fled from us?\\nWe were duty bound to fear so rather than hope so. But at 12:53 in the\\nmorning, a deafening hiss became audible, resembling the sound made by\\na waterspout expelled with tremendous intensity.\\n\\nBy then Commander Farragut, Ned Land, and I were on the afterdeck,\\npeering eagerly into the profound gloom.\\n\\n“Ned Land,” the commander asked, “you’ve often heard whales\\nbellowing?”\\n\\n“Often, sir, but never a whale like this, whose sighting earned me\\n$2,000.00.”\\n\\n“Correct, the prize is rightfully yours. But tell me, isn’t that the\\nnoise cetaceans make when they spurt water from their blowholes?”\\n\\n“The very noise, sir, but this one’s way louder. So there can be no\\nmistake. There’s definitely a whale lurking in our waters. With your\\npermission, sir,” the harpooner added, “tomorrow at daybreak we’ll\\nhave words with it.”\\n\\n“If it’s in a mood to listen to you, Mr. Land,” I replied in a tone\\nfar from convinced.\\n\\n“Let me get within four harpoon lengths of it,” the Canadian shot\\nback, “and it had better listen!”\\n\\n“But to get near it,” the commander went on, “I’d have to put a\\nwhaleboat at your disposal?”\\n\\n“Certainly, sir.”\\n\\n“That would be gambling with the lives of my men.”\\n\\n“And with my own!” the harpooner replied simply.\\n\\nNear two o’clock in the morning, the core of light reappeared, no less\\nintense, five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln. Despite the\\ndistance, despite the noise of wind and sea, we could distinctly hear\\nthe fearsome thrashings of the animal’s tail, and even its panting\\nbreath. Seemingly, the moment this enormous narwhale came up to\\nbreathe at the surface of the ocean, air was sucked into its lungs\\nlike steam into the huge cylinders of a 2,000-horsepower engine.\\n\\n“Hmm!” I said to myself. “A cetacean as powerful as a whole cavalry\\nregiment—now that’s a whale of a whale!”\\n\\nWe stayed on the alert until daylight, getting ready for\\naction. Whaling gear was set up along the railings. Our chief officer\\nloaded the blunderbusses, which can launch harpoons as far as a mile,\\nand long duck guns with exploding bullets that can mortally wound even\\nthe most powerful animals. Ned Land was content to sharpen his\\nharpoon, a dreadful weapon in his hands.\\n\\nAt six o’clock day began to break, and with the dawn’s early light,\\nthe narwhale’s electric glow disappeared. At seven o’clock the day was\\nwell along, but a very dense morning mist shrank the horizon, and our\\nbest spyglasses were unable to pierce it. The outcome: disappointment\\nand anger.\\n\\nI hoisted myself up to the crosstrees of the mizzen sail. Some\\nofficers were already perched on the mastheads.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock the mist rolled ponderously over the waves, and its\\nhuge curls were lifting little by little. The horizon grew wider and\\nclearer all at once.\\n\\nSuddenly, just as on the previous evening, Ned Land’s voice was\\naudible.\\n\\n“There’s the thing in question, astern to port!” the harpooner\\nshouted.\\n\\nEvery eye looked toward the point indicated.\\n\\nThere, a mile and a half from the frigate, a long blackish body\\nemerged a meter above the waves. Quivering violently, its tail was\\ncreating a considerable eddy. Never had caudal equipment thrashed the\\nsea with such power. An immense wake of glowing whiteness marked the\\nanimal’s track, sweeping in a long curve.\\n\\nOur frigate drew nearer to the cetacean. I examined it with a\\ncompletely open mind. Those reports from the Shannon and the Helvetia\\nhad slightly exaggerated its dimensions, and I put its length at only\\n250 feet. Its girth was more difficult to judge, but all in all, the\\nanimal seemed to be wonderfully proportioned in all three dimensions.\\n\\nWhile I was observing this phenomenal creature, two jets of steam and\\nwater sprang from its blowholes and rose to an altitude of forty\\nmeters, which settled for me its mode of breathing. From this I\\nfinally concluded that it belonged to the branch Vertebrata, class\\nMammalia, subclass Monodelphia, group Pisciforma, order Cetacea,\\nfamily . . . but here I couldn’t make up my mind. The order Cetacea\\nconsists of three families, baleen whales, sperm whales, dolphins, and\\nit’s in this last group that narwhales are placed. Each of these\\nfamilies is divided into several genera, each genus into species, each\\nspecies into varieties. So I was still missing variety, species,\\ngenus, and family, but no doubt I would complete my classifying with\\nthe aid of Heaven and Commander Farragut.\\n\\nThe crew were waiting impatiently for orders from their leader. The\\nlatter, after carefully observing the animal, called for his\\nengineer. The engineer raced over.\\n\\n“Sir,” the commander said, “are you up to pressure?”\\n\\n“Aye, sir,” the engineer replied.\\n\\n“Fine. Stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam!”\\n\\nThree cheers greeted this order. The hour of battle had sounded. A few\\nmoments later, the frigate’s two funnels vomited torrents of black\\nsmoke, and its deck quaked from the trembling of its boilers.\\n\\nDriven forward by its powerful propeller, the Abraham Lincoln headed\\nstraight for the animal. Unconcerned, the latter let us come within\\nhalf a cable length; then, not bothering to dive, it got up a little\\nspeed, retreated, and was content to keep its distance.\\n\\nThis chase dragged on for about three-quarters of an hour without the\\nfrigate gaining two fathoms on the cetacean. At this rate, it was\\nobvious that we would never catch up with it.\\n\\nInfuriated, Commander Farragut kept twisting the thick tuft of hair\\nthat flourished below his chin.\\n\\n“Ned Land!” he called.\\n\\nThe Canadian reported at once.\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Land,” the commander asked, “do you still advise putting my\\nlongboats to sea?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” Ned Land replied, “because that beast won’t be caught\\nagainst its will.”\\n\\n“Then what should we do?”\\n\\n“Stoke up more steam, sir, if you can. As for me, with your permission\\nI’ll go perch on the bobstays under the bowsprit, and if we can get\\nwithin a harpoon length, I’ll harpoon the brute.”\\n\\n“Go to it, Ned,” Commander Farragut replied. “Engineer,” he called,\\n“keep the pressure mounting!”\\n\\nNed Land made his way to his post. The furnaces were urged into\\ngreater activity; our propeller did forty-three revolutions per\\nminute, and steam shot from the valves. Heaving the log, we verified\\nthat the Abraham Lincoln was going at the rate of 18.5 miles per hour.\\n\\nBut that damned animal also did a speed of 18.5.\\n\\nFor the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a\\nfathom! This was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the\\nAmerican navy. The crew were working up into a blind rage. Sailor\\nafter sailor heaved insults at the monster, which couldn’t be bothered\\nwith answering back. Commander Farragut was no longer content simply\\nto twist his goatee; he chewed on it.\\n\\nThe engineer was summoned once again.\\n\\n“You’re up to maximum pressure?” the commander asked him.\\n\\n“Aye, sir,” the engineer replied.\\n\\n“And your valves are charged to . . . ?”\\n\\n“To six and a half atmospheres.”\\n\\n“Charge them to ten atmospheres.”\\n\\nA typical American order if I ever heard one. It would have sounded\\njust fine during some Mississippi paddle-wheeler race, to “outstrip\\nthe competition!”\\n\\n“Conseil,” I said to my gallant servant, now at my side, “you realize\\nthat we’ll probably blow ourselves skyhigh?”\\n\\n“As master wishes!” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAll right, I admit it: I did wish to run this risk!\\n\\nThe valves were charged. More coal was swallowed by the\\nfurnaces. Ventilators shot torrents of air over the braziers. The\\nAbraham Lincoln’s speed increased. Its masts trembled down to their\\nblocks, and swirls of smoke could barely squeeze through the narrow\\nfunnels.\\n\\nWe heaved the log a second time.\\n\\n“Well, helmsman?” Commander Farragut asked.\\n\\n“19.3 miles per hour, sir.”\\n\\n“Keep stoking the furnaces.”\\n\\nThe engineer did so. The pressure gauge marked ten atmospheres. But no\\ndoubt the cetacean itself had “warmed up,” because without the least\\ntrouble, it also did 19.3.\\n\\nWhat a chase! No, I can’t describe the excitement that shook my very\\nbeing. Ned Land stayed at his post, harpoon in hand. Several times the\\nanimal let us approach.\\n\\n“We’re overhauling it!” the Canadian would shout.\\n\\nThen, just as he was about to strike, the cetacean would steal off\\nwith a swiftness I could estimate at no less than thirty miles per\\nhour. And even at our maximum speed, it took the liberty of thumbing\\nits nose at the frigate by running a full circle around us! A howl of\\nfury burst from every throat!\\n\\nBy noon we were no farther along than at eight o’clock in the morning.\\n\\nCommander Farragut then decided to use more direct methods.\\n\\n“Bah!” he said. “So that animal is faster than the Abraham\\nLincoln. All right, we’ll see if it can outrun our conical shells!\\nMate, man the gun in the bow!”\\n\\nOur forecastle cannon was immediately loaded and leveled. The\\ncannoneer fired a shot, but his shell passed some feet above the\\ncetacean, which stayed half a mile off.\\n\\n“Over to somebody with better aim!” the commander shouted. “And\\n$500.00 to the man who can pierce that infernal beast!”\\n\\nCalm of eye, cool of feature, an old gray-bearded gunner—I can see him\\nto this day—approached the cannon, put it in position, and took aim\\nfor a good while. There was a mighty explosion, mingled with cheers\\nfrom the crew.\\n\\nThe shell reached its target; it hit the animal, but not in the usual\\nfashion—it bounced off that rounded surface and vanished into the sea\\ntwo miles out.\\n\\n“Oh drat!” said the old gunner in his anger. “That rascal must be\\ncovered with six-inch armor plate!”\\n\\n“Curse the beast!” Commander Farragut shouted.\\n\\nThe hunt was on again, and Commander Farragut leaned over to me,\\nsaying:\\n\\n“I’ll chase that animal till my frigate explodes!”\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, “and nobody would blame you!”\\n\\nWe could still hope that the animal would tire out and not be as\\ninsensitive to exhaustion as our steam engines. But no such luck. Hour\\nafter hour went by without it showing the least sign of weariness.\\n\\nHowever, to the Abraham Lincoln’s credit, it must be said that we\\nstruggled on with tireless persistence. I estimate that we covered a\\ndistance of at least 500 kilometers during this ill-fated day of\\nNovember 6. But night fell and wrapped the surging ocean in its\\nshadows.\\n\\nBy then I thought our expedition had come to an end, that we would\\nnever see this fantastic animal again. I was mistaken.\\n\\nAt 10:50 in the evening, that electric light reappeared three miles to\\nwindward of the frigate, just as clear and intense as the night\\nbefore.\\n\\nThe narwhale seemed motionless. Was it asleep perhaps, weary from its\\nworkday, just riding with the waves? This was our chance, and\\nCommander Farragut was determined to take full advantage of it.\\n\\nHe gave his orders. The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam,\\nadvancing cautiously so as not to awaken its adversary. In midocean\\nit’s not unusual to encounter whales so sound asleep they can\\nsuccessfully be attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned more than one in\\nits slumber. The Canadian went to resume his post on the bobstays\\nunder the bowsprit.\\n\\nThe frigate approached without making a sound, stopped two cable\\nlengths from the animal and coasted. Not a soul breathed on board. A\\nprofound silence reigned over the deck. We were not 100 feet from the\\nblazing core of light, whose glow grew stronger and dazzled the eyes.\\n\\nJust then, leaning over the forecastle railing, I saw Ned Land below\\nme, one hand grasping the martingale, the other brandishing his\\ndreadful harpoon. Barely twenty feet separated him from the motionless\\nanimal.\\n\\nAll at once his arm shot forward and the harpoon was launched. I heard\\nthe weapon collide resonantly, as if it had hit some hard substance.\\n\\nThe electric light suddenly went out, and two enormous waterspouts\\ncrashed onto the deck of the frigate, racing like a torrent from stem\\nto stern, toppling crewmen, breaking spare masts and yardarms from\\ntheir lashings.\\n\\nA hideous collision occurred, and thrown over the rail with no time to\\ncatch hold of it, I was hurled into the sea.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nA Whale of Unknown Species\\n\\n\\nALTHOUGH I WAS startled by this unexpected descent, I at least have a\\nvery clear recollection of my sensations during it.\\n\\nAt first I was dragged about twenty feet under. I’m a good swimmer,\\nwithout claiming to equal such other authors as Byron and Edgar Allan\\nPoe, who were master divers, and I didn’t lose my head on the way\\ndown. With two vigorous kicks of the heel, I came back to the surface\\nof the sea.\\n\\nMy first concern was to look for the frigate. Had the crew seen me go\\noverboard? Was the Abraham Lincoln tacking about? Would Commander\\nFarragut put a longboat to sea? Could I hope to be rescued?\\n\\nThe gloom was profound. I glimpsed a black mass disappearing eastward,\\nwhere its running lights were fading out in the distance. It was the\\nfrigate. I felt I was done for.\\n\\n“Help! Help!” I shouted, swimming desperately toward the Abraham\\nLincoln.\\n\\nMy clothes were weighing me down. The water glued them to my body,\\nthey were paralyzing my movements. I was sinking! I was suffocating\\n. . . !\\n\\n“Help!”\\n\\nThis was the last shout I gave. My mouth was filling with water. I\\nstruggled against being dragged into the depths. . . .\\n\\nSuddenly my clothes were seized by energetic hands, I felt myself\\npulled abruptly back to the surface of the sea, and yes, I heard these\\nwords pronounced in my ear:\\n\\n“If master would oblige me by leaning on my shoulder, master will swim\\nwith much greater ease.”\\n\\nWith one hand I seized the arm of my loyal Conseil.\\n\\n“You!” I said. “You!”\\n\\n“Myself,” Conseil replied, “and at master’s command.”\\n\\n“That collision threw you overboard along with me?”\\n\\n“Not at all. But being in master’s employ, I followed master.”\\n\\nThe fine lad thought this only natural!\\n\\n“What about the frigate?” I asked.\\n\\n“The frigate?” Conseil replied, rolling over on his back. “I think\\nmaster had best not depend on it to any great extent!”\\n\\n“What are you saying?”\\n\\n“I’m saying that just as I jumped overboard, I heard the men at the\\nhelm shout, ‘Our propeller and rudder are smashed!’ ”\\n\\n“Smashed?”\\n\\n“Yes, smashed by the monster’s tusk! I believe it’s the sole injury\\nthe Abraham Lincoln has sustained. But most inconveniently for us, the\\nship can no longer steer.”\\n\\n“Then we’re done for!”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” Conseil replied serenely. “However, we still have a few\\nhours before us, and in a few hours one can do a great many things!”\\n\\nConseil’s unflappable composure cheered me up. I swam more vigorously,\\nbut hampered by clothes that were as restricting as a cloak made of\\nlead, I was managing with only the greatest difficulty. Conseil\\nnoticed as much.\\n\\n“Master will allow me to make an incision,” he said.\\n\\nAnd he slipped an open clasp knife under my clothes, slitting them\\nfrom top to bottom with one swift stroke. Then he briskly undressed me\\nwhile I swam for us both.\\n\\nI then did Conseil the same favor, and we continued to “navigate” side\\nby side.\\n\\nBut our circumstances were no less dreadful. Perhaps they hadn’t seen\\nus go overboard; and even if they had, the frigate—being undone by its\\nrudder—couldn’t return to leeward after us. So we could count only on\\nits longboats.\\n\\nConseil had coolly reasoned out this hypothesis and laid his plans\\naccordingly. An amazing character, this boy; in midocean, this stoic\\nlad seemed right at home!\\n\\nSo, having concluded that our sole chance for salvation lay in being\\npicked up by the Abraham Lincoln’s longboats, we had to take steps to\\nwait for them as long as possible. Consequently, I decided to divide\\nour energies so we wouldn’t both be worn out at the same time, and\\nthis was the arrangement: while one of us lay on his back, staying\\nmotionless with arms crossed and legs outstretched, the other would\\nswim and propel his partner forward. This towing role was to last no\\nlonger than ten minutes, and by relieving each other in this way, we\\ncould stay afloat for hours, perhaps even until daybreak.\\n\\nSlim chance, but hope springs eternal in the human breast! Besides,\\nthere were two of us. Lastly, I can vouch—as improbable as it\\nseems—that even if I had wanted to destroy all my illusions, even if I\\nhad been willing to “give in to despair,” I could not have done so!\\n\\nThe cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o’clock in the\\nevening. I therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming until\\nsunrise. A strenuous task, but feasible, thanks to our relieving each\\nother. The sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us. Sometimes I\\ntried to peer through the dense gloom, which was broken only by the\\nphosphorescent flickers coming from our movements. I stared at the\\nluminous ripples breaking over my hands, shimmering sheets spattered\\nwith blotches of bluish gray. It seemed as if we’d plunged into a pool\\nof quicksilver.\\n\\nNear one o’clock in the morning, I was overcome with tremendous\\nexhaustion. My limbs stiffened in the grip of intense cramps. Conseil\\nhad to keep me going, and attending to our self-preservation became\\nhis sole responsibility. I soon heard the poor lad gasping; his\\nbreathing became shallow and quick. I didn’t think he could stand such\\nexertions for much longer.\\n\\n“Go on! Go on!” I told him.\\n\\n“Leave master behind?” he replied. “Never! I’ll drown before he does!”\\n\\nJust then, past the fringes of a large cloud that the wind was driving\\neastward, the moon appeared. The surface of the sea glistened under\\nits rays. That kindly light rekindled our strength. I held up my head\\nagain. My eyes darted to every point of the horizon. I spotted the\\nfrigate. It was five miles from us and formed no more than a dark,\\nbarely perceptible mass. But as for longboats, not a one in sight!\\n\\nI tried to call out. What was the use at such a distance! My swollen\\nlips wouldn’t let a single sound through. Conseil could still\\narticulate a few words, and I heard him repeat at intervals:\\n\\n“Help! Help!”\\n\\nCeasing all movement for an instant, we listened. And it may have been\\na ringing in my ear, from this organ filling with impeded blood, but\\nit seemed to me that Conseil’s shout had received an answer back.\\n\\n“Did you hear that?” I muttered.\\n\\n“Yes, yes!”\\n\\nAnd Conseil hurled another desperate plea into space.\\n\\nThis time there could be no mistake! A human voice had answered us!\\nWas it the voice of some poor devil left behind in midocean, some\\nother victim of that collision suffered by our ship? Or was it one of\\nthe frigate’s longboats, hailing us out of the gloom?\\n\\nConseil made one final effort, and bracing his hands on my shoulders,\\nwhile I offered resistance with one supreme exertion, he raised\\nhimself half out of the water, then fell back exhausted.\\n\\n“What did you see?”\\n\\n“I saw . . . ,” he muttered, “I saw . . . but we mustn’t talk\\n. . . save our strength . . . !”\\n\\nWhat had he seen? Then, lord knows why, the thought of the monster\\ncame into my head for the first time . . . ! But even so, that voice\\n. . . ? Gone are the days when Jonahs took refuge in the bellies of\\nwhales!\\n\\nNevertheless, Conseil kept towing me. Sometimes he looked up, stared\\nstraight ahead, and shouted a request for directions, which was\\nanswered by a voice that was getting closer and closer. I could barely\\nhear it. I was at the end of my strength; my fingers gave out; my\\nhands were no help to me; my mouth opened convulsively, filling with\\nbrine; its coldness ran through me; I raised my head one last time,\\nthen I collapsed. . . .\\n\\nJust then something hard banged against me. I clung to it. Then I felt\\nmyself being pulled upward, back to the surface of the water; my chest\\ncaved in, and I fainted. . . .\\n\\nFor certain, I came to quickly, because someone was massaging me so\\nvigorously it left furrows in my flesh. I half opened my eyes. . . .\\n\\n“Conseil!” I muttered.\\n\\n“Did master ring for me?” Conseil replied.\\n\\nJust then, in the last light of a moon settling on the horizon, I\\nspotted a face that wasn’t Conseil’s but which I recognized at once.\\n\\n“Ned!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“In person, sir, and still after his prize!” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“You were thrown overboard after the frigate’s collision?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor, but I was luckier than you, and right away I was able\\nto set foot on this floating islet.”\\n\\n“Islet?”\\n\\n“Or in other words, on our gigantic narwhale.”\\n\\n“Explain yourself, Ned.”\\n\\n“It’s just that I soon realized why my harpoon got blunted and\\ncouldn’t puncture its hide.”\\n\\n“Why, Ned, why?”\\n\\n“Because, professor, this beast is made of boilerplate steel!”\\n\\nAt this point in my story, I need to get a grip on myself, reconstruct\\nexactly what I experienced, and make doubly sure of everything I\\nwrite.\\n\\nThe Canadian’s last words caused a sudden upheaval in my brain. I\\nswiftly hoisted myself to the summit of this half-submerged creature\\nor object that was serving as our refuge. I tested it with my\\nfoot. Obviously it was some hard, impenetrable substance, not the soft\\nmatter that makes up the bodies of our big marine mammals.\\n\\nBut this hard substance could have been a bony carapace, like those\\nthat covered some prehistoric animals, and I might have left it at\\nthat and classified this monster among such amphibious reptiles as\\nturtles or alligators.\\n\\nWell, no. The blackish back supporting me was smooth and polished with\\nno overlapping scales. On impact, it gave off a metallic sonority, and\\nas incredible as this sounds, it seemed, I swear, to be made of\\nriveted plates.\\n\\nNo doubts were possible! This animal, this monster, this natural\\nphenomenon that had puzzled the whole scientific world, that had\\nmuddled and misled the minds of seamen in both hemispheres, was, there\\ncould be no escaping it, an even more astonishing phenomenon—a\\nphenomenon made by the hand of man.\\n\\nEven if I had discovered that some fabulous, mythological creature\\nreally existed, it wouldn’t have given me such a terrific mental\\njolt. It’s easy enough to accept that prodigious things can come from\\nour Creator. But to find, all at once, right before your eyes, that\\nthe impossible had been mysteriously achieved by man himself: this\\nstaggers the mind!\\n\\nBut there was no question now. We were stretched out on the back of\\nsome kind of underwater boat that, as far as I could judge, boasted\\nthe shape of an immense steel fish. Ned Land had clear views on the\\nissue. Conseil and I could only line up behind him.\\n\\n“But then,” I said, “does this contraption contain some sort of\\nlocomotive mechanism, and a crew to run it?”\\n\\n“Apparently,” the harpooner replied. “And yet for the three hours I’ve\\nlived on this floating island, it hasn’t shown a sign of life.”\\n\\n“This boat hasn’t moved at all?”\\n\\n“No, Professor Aronnax. It just rides with the waves, but otherwise it\\nhasn’t stirred.”\\n\\n“But we know that it’s certainly gifted with great speed. Now then,\\nsince an engine is needed to generate that speed, and a mechanic to\\nrun that engine, I conclude: we’re saved.”\\n\\n“Humph!” Ned Land put in, his tone denoting reservations.\\n\\nJust then, as if to take my side in the argument, a bubbling began\\nastern of this strange submersible—whose drive mechanism was obviously\\na propeller—and the boat started to move. We barely had time to hang\\non to its topside, which emerged about eighty centimeters above\\nwater. Fortunately its speed was not excessive.\\n\\n“So long as it navigates horizontally,” Ned Land muttered, “I’ve no\\ncomplaints. But if it gets the urge to dive, I wouldn’t give $2.00 for\\nmy hide!”\\n\\nThe Canadian might have quoted a much lower price. So it was\\nimperative to make contact with whatever beings were confined inside\\nthe plating of this machine. I searched its surface for an opening or\\na hatch, a “manhole,” to use the official term; but the lines of\\nrivets had been firmly driven into the sheet-iron joins and were\\nstraight and uniform.\\n\\nMoreover, the moon then disappeared and left us in profound\\ndarkness. We had to wait for daylight to find some way of getting\\ninside this underwater boat.\\n\\nSo our salvation lay totally in the hands of the mysterious helmsmen\\nsteering this submersible, and if it made a dive, we were done for!\\nBut aside from this occurring, I didn’t doubt the possibility of our\\nmaking contact with them. In fact, if they didn’t produce their own\\nair, they inevitably had to make periodic visits to the surface of the\\nocean to replenish their oxygen supply. Hence the need for some\\nopening that put the boat’s interior in contact with the atmosphere.\\n\\nAs for any hope of being rescued by Commander Farragut, that had to be\\nrenounced completely. We were being swept westward, and I estimate\\nthat our comparatively moderate speed reached twelve miles per\\nhour. The propeller churned the waves with mathematical regularity,\\nsometimes emerging above the surface and throwing phosphorescent spray\\nto great heights.\\n\\nNear four o’clock in the morning, the submersible picked up speed. We\\ncould barely cope with this dizzying rush, and the waves battered us\\nat close range. Fortunately Ned’s hands came across a big mooring ring\\nfastened to the topside of this sheet-iron back, and we all held on\\nfor dear life.\\n\\nFinally this long night was over. My imperfect memories won’t let me\\nrecall my every impression of it. A single detail comes back to\\nme. Several times, during various lulls of wind and sea, I thought I\\nheard indistinct sounds, a sort of elusive harmony produced by distant\\nmusical chords. What was the secret behind this underwater navigating,\\nwhose explanation the whole world had sought in vain? What beings\\nlived inside this strange boat? What mechanical force allowed it to\\nmove about with such prodigious speed?\\n\\nDaylight appeared. The morning mists surrounded us, but they soon\\nbroke up. I was about to proceed with a careful examination of the\\nhull, whose topside formed a sort of horizontal platform, when I felt\\nit sinking little by little.\\n\\n“Oh, damnation!” Ned Land shouted, stamping his foot on the resonant\\nsheet iron. “Open up there, you antisocial navigators!”\\n\\nBut it was difficult to make yourself heard above the deafening beats\\nof the propeller. Fortunately this submerging movement stopped.\\n\\nFrom inside the boat, there suddenly came noises of iron fastenings\\npushed roughly aside. One of the steel plates flew up, a man appeared,\\ngave a bizarre yell, and instantly disappeared.\\n\\nA few moments later, eight strapping fellows appeared silently, their\\nfaces like masks, and dragged us down into their fearsome machine.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\n“Mobilis in Mobili”\\n\\n\\nTHIS BRUTALLY EXECUTED capture was carried out with lightning\\nspeed. My companions and I had no time to collect ourselves. I don’t\\nknow how they felt about being shoved inside this aquatic prison, but\\nas for me, I was shivering all over. With whom were we dealing? Surely\\nwith some new breed of pirates, exploiting the sea after their own\\nfashion.\\n\\nThe narrow hatch had barely closed over me when I was surrounded by\\nprofound darkness. Saturated with the outside light, my eyes couldn’t\\nmake out a thing. I felt my naked feet clinging to the steps of an\\niron ladder. Forcibly seized, Ned Land and Conseil were behind me. At\\nthe foot of the ladder, a door opened and instantly closed behind us\\nwith a loud clang.\\n\\nWe were alone. Where? I couldn’t say, could barely even imagine. All\\nwas darkness, but such utter darkness that after several minutes, my\\neyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams that\\ndrift through even the blackest nights.\\n\\nMeanwhile, furious at these goings on, Ned Land gave free rein to his\\nindignation.\\n\\n“Damnation!” he exclaimed. “These people are about as hospitable as\\nthe savages of New Caledonia! All that’s lacking is for them to be\\ncannibals! I wouldn’t be surprised if they were, but believe you me,\\nthey won’t eat me without my kicking up a protest!”\\n\\n“Calm yourself, Ned my friend,” Conseil replied serenely. “Don’t flare\\nup so quickly! We aren’t in a kettle yet!”\\n\\n“In a kettle, no,” the Canadian shot back, “but in an oven for\\nsure. It’s dark enough for one. Luckily my Bowie knife hasn’t left me,\\nand I can still see well enough to put it to use.* The first one of\\nthese bandits who lays a hand on me—”\\n\\n*Author’s Note: A Bowie knife is a wide-bladed dagger that Americans\\n are forever carrying around.\\n\\n“Don’t be so irritable, Ned,” I then told the harpooner, “and don’t\\nruin things for us with pointless violence. Who knows whether they\\nmight be listening to us? Instead, let’s try to find out where we\\nare!”\\n\\nI started moving, groping my way. After five steps I encountered an\\niron wall made of riveted boilerplate. Then, turning around, I bumped\\ninto a wooden table next to which several stools had been set. The\\nfloor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick, hempen matting that\\ndeadened the sound of footsteps. Its naked walls didn’t reveal any\\ntrace of a door or window. Going around the opposite way, Conseil met\\nup with me, and we returned to the middle of this cabin, which had to\\nbe twenty feet long by ten wide. As for its height, not even Ned Land,\\nwith his great stature, was able to determine it.\\n\\nHalf an hour had already gone by without our situation changing, when\\nour eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into blinding\\nlight. Our prison lit up all at once; in other words, it filled with\\nluminescent matter so intense that at first I couldn’t stand the\\nbrightness of it. From its glare and whiteness, I recognized the\\nelectric glow that had played around this underwater boat like some\\nmagnificent phosphorescent phenomenon. After involuntarily closing my\\neyes, I reopened them and saw that this luminous force came from a\\nfrosted half globe curving out of the cabin’s ceiling.\\n\\n“Finally! It’s light enough to see!” Ned Land exclaimed, knife in\\nhand, staying on the defensive.\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, then ventured the opposite view. “But as for our\\nsituation, we’re still in the dark.”\\n\\n“Master must learn patience,” said the emotionless Conseil.\\n\\nThis sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its\\ntiniest details. It contained only a table and five stools. Its\\ninvisible door must have been hermetically sealed. Not a sound reached\\nour ears. Everything seemed dead inside this boat. Was it in motion,\\nor stationary on the surface of the ocean, or sinking into the depths?\\nI couldn’t tell.\\n\\nBut this luminous globe hadn’t been turned on without good\\nreason. Consequently, I hoped that some crewmen would soon make an\\nappearance. If you want to consign people to oblivion, you don’t light\\nup their dungeons.\\n\\nI was not mistaken. Unlocking noises became audible, a door opened,\\nand two men appeared.\\n\\nOne was short and stocky, powerfully muscled, broad shouldered, robust\\nof limbs, the head squat, the hair black and luxuriant, the mustache\\nheavy, the eyes bright and penetrating, and his whole personality\\nstamped with that southern-blooded zest that, in France, typifies the\\npeople of Provence. The philosopher Diderot has very aptly claimed\\nthat a man’s bearing is the clue to his character, and this stocky\\nlittle man was certainly a living proof of this claim. You could sense\\nthat his everyday conversation must have been packed with such vivid\\nfigures of speech as personification, symbolism, and misplaced\\nmodifiers. But I was never in a position to verify this because,\\naround me, he used only an odd and utterly incomprehensible dialect.\\n\\nThe second stranger deserves a more detailed description. A disciple\\nof such character-judging anatomists as Gratiolet or Engel could have\\nread this man’s features like an open book. Without hesitation, I\\nidentified his dominant qualities—self-confidence, since his head\\nreared like a nobleman’s above the arc formed by the lines of his\\nshoulders, and his black eyes gazed with icy assurance; calmness,\\nsince his skin, pale rather than ruddy, indicated tranquility of\\nblood; energy, shown by the swiftly knitting muscles of his brow; and\\nfinally courage, since his deep breathing denoted tremendous reserves\\nof vitality.\\n\\nI might add that this was a man of great pride, that his calm, firm\\ngaze seemed to reflect thinking on an elevated plane, and that the\\nharmony of his facial expressions and bodily movements resulted in an\\noverall effect of unquestionable candor—according to the findings of\\nphysiognomists, those analysts of facial character.\\n\\nI felt “involuntarily reassured” in his presence, and this boded well\\nfor our interview.\\n\\nWhether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I could\\nnot precisely state. He was tall, his forehead broad, his nose\\nstraight, his mouth clearly etched, his teeth magnificent, his hands\\nrefined, tapered, and to use a word from palmistry, highly “psychic,”\\nin other words, worthy of serving a lofty and passionate spirit. This\\nman was certainly the most wonderful physical specimen I had ever\\nencountered. One unusual detail: his eyes were spaced a little far\\nfrom each other and could instantly take in nearly a quarter of the\\nhorizon. This ability—as I later verified—was strengthened by a range\\nof vision even greater than Ned Land’s. When this stranger focused his\\ngaze on an object, his eyebrow lines gathered into a frown, his heavy\\neyelids closed around his pupils to contract his huge field of vision,\\nand he looked! What a look—as if he could magnify objects shrinking\\ninto the distance; as if he could probe your very soul; as if he could\\npierce those sheets of water so opaque to our eyes and scan the\\ndeepest seas . . . !\\n\\nWearing caps made of sea-otter fur, and shod in sealskin fishing\\nboots, these two strangers were dressed in clothing made from some\\nunique fabric that flattered the figure and allowed great freedom of\\nmovement.\\n\\nThe taller of the two—apparently the leader on board—examined us with\\nthe greatest care but without pronouncing a word. Then, turning to his\\ncompanion, he conversed with him in a language I didn’t recognize. It\\nwas a sonorous, harmonious, flexible dialect whose vowels seemed to\\nundergo a highly varied accentuation.\\n\\nThe other replied with a shake of the head and added two or three\\nutterly incomprehensible words. Then he seemed to question me directly\\nwith a long stare.\\n\\nI replied in clear French that I wasn’t familiar with his language;\\nbut he didn’t seem to understand me, and the situation grew rather\\nbaffling.\\n\\n“Still, master should tell our story,” Conseil said to me. “Perhaps\\nthese gentlemen will grasp a few words of it!”\\n\\nI tried again, telling the tale of our adventures, clearly\\narticulating my every syllable, and not leaving out a single detail. I\\nstated our names and titles; then, in order, I introduced Professor\\nAronnax, his manservant Conseil, and Mr. Ned Land, harpooner.\\n\\nThe man with calm, gentle eyes listened to me serenely, even\\ncourteously, and paid remarkable attention. But nothing in his facial\\nexpression indicated that he understood my story. When I finished, he\\ndidn’t pronounce a single word.\\n\\nOne resource still left was to speak English. Perhaps they would be\\nfamiliar with this nearly universal language. But I only knew it, as I\\ndid the German language, well enough to read it fluently, not well\\nenough to speak it correctly. Here, however, our overriding need was\\nto make ourselves understood.\\n\\n“Come on, it’s your turn,” I told the harpooner. “Over to you,\\nMr. Land. Pull out of your bag of tricks the best English ever spoken\\nby an Anglo-Saxon, and try for a more favorable result than mine.”\\n\\nNed needed no persuading and started our story all over again, most of\\nwhich I could follow. Its content was the same, but the form\\ndiffered. Carried away by his volatile temperament, the Canadian put\\ngreat animation into it. He complained vehemently about being\\nimprisoned in defiance of his civil rights, asked by virtue of which\\nlaw he was hereby detained, invoked writs of habeas corpus, threatened\\nto press charges against anyone holding him in illegal custody,\\nranted, gesticulated, shouted, and finally conveyed by an expressive\\ngesture that we were dying of hunger.\\n\\nThis was perfectly true, but we had nearly forgotten the fact.\\n\\nMuch to his amazement, the harpooner seemed no more intelligible than\\nI had been. Our visitors didn’t bat an eye. Apparently they were\\nengineers who understood the languages of neither the French physicist\\nArago nor the English physicist Faraday.\\n\\nThoroughly baffled after vainly exhausting our philological resources,\\nI no longer knew what tactic to pursue, when Conseil told me:\\n\\n“If master will authorize me, I’ll tell the whole business in German.”\\n\\n“What! You know German?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Like most Flemish people, with all due respect to master.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, my respect is due you. Go to it, my boy.”\\n\\nAnd Conseil, in his serene voice, described for the third time the\\nvarious vicissitudes of our story. But despite our narrator’s fine\\naccent and stylish turns of phrase, the German language met with no\\nsuccess.\\n\\nFinally, as a last resort, I hauled out everything I could remember\\nfrom my early schooldays, and I tried to narrate our adventures in\\nLatin. Cicero would have plugged his ears and sent me to the scullery,\\nbut somehow I managed to pull through. With the same negative result.\\n\\nThis last attempt ultimately misfiring, the two strangers exchanged a\\nfew words in their incomprehensible language and withdrew, not even\\nfavoring us with one of those encouraging gestures that are used in\\nevery country in the world. The door closed again.\\n\\n“This is outrageous!” Ned Land shouted, exploding for the twentieth\\ntime. “I ask you! We speak French, English, German, and Latin to these\\nrogues, and neither of them has the decency to even answer back!”\\n\\n“Calm down, Ned,” I told the seething harpooner. “Anger won’t get us\\nanywhere.”\\n\\n“But professor,” our irascible companion went on, “can’t you see that\\nwe could die of hunger in this iron cage?”\\n\\n“Bah!” Conseil put in philosophically. “We can hold out a good while\\nyet!”\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “we mustn’t despair. We’ve gotten out of tighter\\nspots. So please do me the favor of waiting a bit before you form your\\nviews on the commander and crew of this boat.”\\n\\n“My views are fully formed,” Ned Land shot back. “They’re rogues!”\\n\\n“Oh good! And from what country?”\\n\\n“Roguedom!”\\n\\n“My gallant Ned, as yet that country isn’t clearly marked on maps of\\nthe world, but I admit that the nationality of these two strangers is\\nhard to make out! Neither English, French, nor German, that’s all we\\ncan say. But I’m tempted to think that the commander and his chief\\nofficer were born in the low latitudes. There must be southern blood\\nin them. But as to whether they’re Spaniards, Turks, Arabs, or East\\nIndians, their physical characteristics don’t give me enough to go\\non. And as for their speech, it’s utterly incomprehensible.”\\n\\n“That’s the nuisance in not knowing every language,” Conseil replied,\\n“or the drawback in not having one universal language!”\\n\\n“Which would all go out the window!” Ned Land replied. “Don’t you see,\\nthese people have a language all to themselves, a language they’ve\\ninvented just to cause despair in decent people who ask for a little\\ndinner! Why, in every country on earth, when you open your mouth, snap\\nyour jaws, smack your lips and teeth, isn’t that the world’s most\\nunderstandable message? From Quebec to the Tuamotu Islands, from Paris\\nto the Antipodes, doesn’t it mean: I’m hungry, give me a bite to eat!”\\n\\n“Oh,” Conseil put in, “there are some people so unintelligent by\\nnature . . .”\\n\\nAs he was saying these words, the door opened. A steward entered.* He\\nbrought us some clothes, jackets and sailor’s pants, made out of a\\nfabric whose nature I didn’t recognize. I hurried to change into them,\\nand my companions followed suit.\\n\\n*Author’s Note: A steward is a waiter on board a steamer.\\n\\nMeanwhile our silent steward, perhaps a deaf-mute, set the table and\\nlaid three place settings.\\n\\n“There’s something serious afoot,” Conseil said, “and it bodes well.”\\n\\n“Bah!” replied the rancorous harpooner. “What the devil do you suppose\\nthey eat around here? Turtle livers, loin of shark, dogfish steaks?”\\n\\n“We’ll soon find out!” Conseil said.\\n\\nOverlaid with silver dish covers, various platters had been neatly\\npositioned on the table cloth, and we sat down to eat. Assuredly, we\\nwere dealing with civilized people, and if it hadn’t been for this\\nelectric light flooding over us, I would have thought we were in the\\ndining room of the Hotel Adelphi in Liverpool, or the Grand Hotel in\\nParis. However, I feel compelled to mention that bread and wine were\\ntotally absent. The water was fresh and clear, but it was still\\nwater—which wasn’t what Ned Land had in mind. Among the foods we were\\nserved, I was able to identify various daintily dressed fish; but I\\ncouldn’t make up my mind about certain otherwise excellent dishes, and\\nI couldn’t even tell whether their contents belonged to the vegetable\\nor the animal kingdom. As for the tableware, it was elegant and in\\nperfect taste. Each utensil, spoon, fork, knife, and plate, bore on\\nits reverse a letter encircled by a Latin motto, and here is its exact\\nduplicate:\\n\\n  MOBILIS IN MOBILI\\n  N\\n\\nMoving within the moving element! It was a highly appropriate motto\\nfor this underwater machine, so long as the preposition in is\\ntranslated as within and not upon. The letter N was no doubt the\\ninitial of the name of that mystifying individual in command beneath\\nthe seas!\\n\\nNed and Conseil had no time for such musings. They were wolfing down\\ntheir food, and without further ado I did the same. By now I felt\\nreassured about our fate, and it seemed obvious that our hosts didn’t\\nintend to let us die of starvation.\\n\\nBut all earthly things come to an end, all things must pass, even the\\nhunger of people who haven’t eaten for fifteen hours. Our appetites\\nappeased, we felt an urgent need for sleep. A natural reaction after\\nthat interminable night of fighting for our lives.\\n\\n“Ye gods, I’ll sleep soundly,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Me, I’m out like a light!” Ned Land replied.\\n\\nMy two companions lay down on the cabin’s carpeting and were soon deep\\nin slumber.\\n\\nAs for me, I gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep. Too\\nmany thoughts had piled up in my mind, too many insoluble questions\\nhad arisen, too many images were keeping my eyelids open! Where were\\nwe? What strange power was carrying us along? I felt—or at least I\\nthought I did—the submersible sinking toward the sea’s lower\\nstrata. Intense nightmares besieged me. In these mysterious marine\\nsanctuaries, I envisioned hosts of unknown animals, and this\\nunderwater boat seemed to be a blood relation of theirs: living,\\nbreathing, just as fearsome . . . ! Then my mind grew calmer, my\\nimagination melted into hazy drowsiness, and I soon fell into an\\nuneasy slumber.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nThe Tantrums of Ned Land\\n\\n\\nI HAVE NO IDEA how long this slumber lasted; but it must have been a\\ngood while, since we were completely over our exhaustion. I was the\\nfirst one to wake up. My companions weren’t yet stirring and still lay\\nin their corners like inanimate objects.\\n\\nI had barely gotten up from my passably hard mattress when I felt my\\nmind clear, my brain go on the alert. So I began a careful\\nreexamination of our cell.\\n\\nNothing had changed in its interior arrangements. The prison was still\\na prison and its prisoners still prisoners. But, taking advantage of\\nour slumber, the steward had cleared the table. Consequently, nothing\\nindicated any forthcoming improvement in our situation, and I\\nseriously wondered if we were doomed to spend the rest of our lives in\\nthis cage.\\n\\nThis prospect seemed increasingly painful to me because, even though\\nmy brain was clear of its obsessions from the night before, I was\\nfeeling an odd short-windedness in my chest. It was becoming hard for\\nme to breathe. The heavy air was no longer sufficient for the full\\nplay of my lungs. Although our cell was large, we obviously had used\\nup most of the oxygen it contained. In essence, over an hour’s time a\\nsingle human being consumes all the oxygen found in 100 liters of air,\\nat which point that air has become charged with a nearly equal amount\\nof carbon dioxide and is no longer fit for breathing.\\n\\nSo it was now urgent to renew the air in our prison, and no doubt the\\nair in this whole underwater boat as well.\\n\\nHere a question popped into my head. How did the commander of this\\naquatic residence go about it? Did he obtain air using chemical\\nmethods, releasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by\\nheating it, meanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium\\nhydroxide? If so, he would have to keep up some kind of relationship\\nwith the shore, to come by the materials needed for such an\\noperation. Did he simply limit himself to storing the air in\\nhigh-pressure tanks and then dispense it according to his crew’s\\nneeds? Perhaps. Or, proceeding in a more convenient, more economical,\\nand consequently more probable fashion, was he satisfied with merely\\nreturning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean,\\nrenewing his oxygen supply every twenty-four hours? In any event,\\nwhatever his method was, it seemed prudent to me that he use this\\nmethod without delay.\\n\\nIn fact, I had already resorted to speeding up my inhalations in order\\nto extract from the cell what little oxygen it contained, when\\nsuddenly I was refreshed by a current of clean air, scented with a\\nsalty aroma. It had to be a sea breeze, life-giving and charged with\\niodine! I opened my mouth wide, and my lungs glutted themselves on the\\nfresh particles. At the same time, I felt a swaying, a rolling of\\nmoderate magnitude but definitely noticeable. This boat, this\\nsheet-iron monster, had obviously just risen to the surface of the\\nocean, there to breathe in good whale fashion. So the ship’s mode of\\nventilation was finally established.\\n\\nWhen I had absorbed a chestful of this clean air, I looked for the\\nconduit—the “air carrier,” if you prefer—that allowed this beneficial\\ninflux to reach us, and I soon found it. Above the door opened an air\\nvent that let in a fresh current of oxygen, renewing the thin air in\\nour cell.\\n\\nI had gotten to this point in my observations when Ned and Conseil\\nwoke up almost simultaneously, under the influence of this reviving\\nair purification. They rubbed their eyes, stretched their arms, and\\nsprang to their feet.\\n\\n“Did master sleep well?” Conseil asked me with his perennial good\\nmanners.\\n\\n“Extremely well, my gallant lad,” I replied. “And how about you,\\nMr. Ned Land?”\\n\\n“Like a log, professor. But I must be imagining things, because it\\nseems like I’m breathing a sea breeze!”\\n\\nA seaman couldn’t be wrong on this topic, and I told the Canadian what\\nhad gone on while he slept.\\n\\n“Good!” he said. “That explains perfectly all that bellowing we heard,\\nwhen our so-called narwhale lay in sight of the Abraham Lincoln.”\\n\\n“Perfectly, Mr. Land. It was catching its breath!”\\n\\n“Only I’ve no idea what time it is, Professor Aronnax, unless maybe\\nit’s dinnertime?”\\n\\n“Dinnertime, my fine harpooner? I’d say at least breakfast time,\\nbecause we’ve certainly woken up to a new day.”\\n\\n“Which indicates,” Conseil replied, “that we’ve spent twenty-four\\nhours in slumber.”\\n\\n“That’s my assessment,” I replied.\\n\\n“I won’t argue with you,” Ned Land answered. “But dinner or breakfast,\\nthat steward will be plenty welcome whether he brings the one or the\\nother.”\\n\\n“The one and the other,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Well put,” the Canadian replied. “We deserve two meals, and speaking\\nfor myself, I’ll do justice to them both.”\\n\\n“All right, Ned, let’s wait and see!” I replied. “It’s clear that\\nthese strangers don’t intend to let us die of hunger, otherwise last\\nevening’s dinner wouldn’t make any sense.”\\n\\n“Unless they’re fattening us up!” Ned shot back.\\n\\n“I object,” I replied. “We have not fallen into the hands of\\ncannibals.”\\n\\n“Just because they don’t make a habit of it,” the Canadian replied in\\nall seriousness, “doesn’t mean they don’t indulge from time to\\ntime. Who knows? Maybe these people have gone without fresh meat for a\\nlong while, and in that case three healthy, well-built specimens like\\nthe professor, his manservant, and me —-”\\n\\n“Get rid of those ideas, Mr. Land,” I answered the harpooner. “And\\nabove all, don’t let them lead you to flare up against our hosts,\\nwhich would only make our situation worse.”\\n\\n“Anyhow,” the harpooner said, “I’m as hungry as all Hades, and dinner\\nor breakfast, not one puny meal has arrived!”\\n\\n“Mr. Land,” I answered, “we have to adapt to the schedule on board,\\nand I imagine our stomachs are running ahead of the chief cook’s\\ndinner bell.”\\n\\n“Well then, we’ll adjust our stomachs to the chef’s timetable!”\\nConseil replied serenely.\\n\\n“There you go again, Conseil my friend!” the impatient Canadian shot\\nback. “You never allow yourself any displays of bile or attacks of\\nnerves! You’re everlastingly calm! You’d say your after-meal grace\\neven if you didn’t get any food for your before-meal blessing—and\\nyou’d starve to death rather than complain!”\\n\\n“What good would it do?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Complaining doesn’t have to do good, it just feels good! And if these\\npirates—I say pirates out of consideration for the professor’s\\nfeelings, since he doesn’t want us to call them cannibals—if these\\npirates think they’re going to smother me in this cage without hearing\\nwhat cusswords spice up my outbursts, they’ve got another think\\ncoming! Look here, Professor Aronnax, speak frankly. How long do you\\nfigure they’ll keep us in this iron box?”\\n\\n“To tell the truth, friend Land, I know little more about it than you\\ndo.”\\n\\n“But in a nutshell, what do you suppose is going on?”\\n\\n“My supposition is that sheer chance has made us privy to an important\\nsecret. Now then, if the crew of this underwater boat have a personal\\ninterest in keeping that secret, and if their personal interest is\\nmore important than the lives of three men, I believe that our very\\nexistence is in jeopardy. If such is not the case, then at the first\\navailable opportunity, this monster that has swallowed us will return\\nus to the world inhabited by our own kind.”\\n\\n“Unless they recruit us to serve on the crew,” Conseil said, “and keep\\nus here—”\\n\\n“Till the moment,” Ned Land answered, “when some frigate that’s faster\\nor smarter than the Abraham Lincoln captures this den of buccaneers,\\nthen hangs all of us by the neck from the tip of a mainmast yardarm!”\\n\\n“Well thought out, Mr. Land,” I replied. “But as yet, I don’t believe\\nwe’ve been tendered any enlistment offers. Consequently, it’s\\npointless to argue about what tactics we should pursue in such a\\ncase. I repeat: let’s wait, let’s be guided by events, and let’s do\\nnothing, since right now there’s nothing we can do.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, professor,” the harpooner replied, not wanting to\\ngive in. “There is something we can do.”\\n\\n“Oh? And what, Mr. Land?”\\n\\n“Break out of here!”\\n\\n“Breaking out of a prison on shore is difficult enough, but with an\\nunderwater prison, it strikes me as completely unworkable.”\\n\\n“Come now, Ned my friend,” Conseil asked, “how would you answer\\nmaster’s objection? I refuse to believe that an American is at the end\\nof his tether.”\\n\\nVisibly baffled, the harpooner said nothing. Under the conditions in\\nwhich fate had left us, it was absolutely impossible to escape. But a\\nCanadian’s wit is half French, and Mr. Ned Land made this clear in his\\nreply.\\n\\n“So, Professor Aronnax,” he went on after thinking for a few moments,\\n“you haven’t figured out what people do when they can’t escape from\\ntheir prison?”\\n\\n“No, my friend.”\\n\\n“Easy. They fix things so they stay there.”\\n\\n“Of course!” Conseil put in. “Since we’re deep in the ocean, being\\ninside this boat is vastly preferable to being above it or below it!”\\n\\n“But we fix things by kicking out all the jailers, guards, and\\nwardens,” Ned Land added.\\n\\n“What’s this, Ned?” I asked. “You’d seriously consider taking over\\nthis craft?”\\n\\n“Very seriously,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“It’s impossible.”\\n\\n“And why is that, sir? Some promising opportunity might come up, and I\\ndon’t see what could stop us from taking advantage of it. If there are\\nonly about twenty men on board this machine, I don’t think they can\\nstave off two Frenchmen and a Canadian!”\\n\\nIt seemed wiser to accept the harpooner’s proposition than to debate\\nit. Accordingly, I was content to reply:\\n\\n“Let such circumstances come, Mr. Land, and we’ll see. But until then,\\nI beg you to control your impatience. We need to act shrewdly, and\\nyour flare-ups won’t give rise to any promising opportunities. So\\nswear to me that you’ll accept our situation without throwing a\\ntantrum over it.”\\n\\n“I give you my word, professor,” Ned Land replied in an unenthusiastic\\ntone. “No vehement phrases will leave my mouth, no vicious gestures\\nwill give my feelings away, not even when they don’t feed us on time.”\\n\\n“I have your word, Ned,” I answered the Canadian.\\n\\nThen our conversation petered out, and each of us withdrew into his\\nown thoughts. For my part, despite the harpooner’s confident talk, I\\nadmit that I entertained no illusions. I had no faith in those\\npromising opportunities that Ned Land mentioned. To operate with such\\nefficiency, this underwater boat had to have a sizeable crew, so if it\\ncame to a physical contest, we would be facing an overwhelming\\nopponent. Besides, before we could do anything, we had to be free, and\\nthat we definitely were not. I didn’t see any way out of this\\nsheet-iron, hermetically sealed cell. And if the strange commander of\\nthis boat did have a secret to keep—which seemed rather likely—he\\nwould never give us freedom of movement aboard his vessel. Now then,\\nwould he resort to violence in order to be rid of us, or would he drop\\nus off one day on some remote coast? There lay the unknown. All these\\nhypotheses seemed extremely plausible to me, and to hope for freedom\\nthrough use of force, you had to be a harpooner.\\n\\nI realized, moreover, that Ned Land’s brooding was getting him madder\\nby the minute. Little by little, I heard those aforesaid cusswords\\nwelling up in the depths of his gullet, and I saw his movements turn\\nthreatening again. He stood up, pacing in circles like a wild beast in\\na cage, striking the walls with his foot and fist. Meanwhile the hours\\npassed, our hunger nagged unmercifully, and this time the steward did\\nnot appear. Which amounted to forgetting our castaway status for much\\ntoo long, if they really had good intentions toward us.\\n\\nTortured by the growling of his well-built stomach, Ned Land was\\ngetting more and more riled, and despite his word of honor, I was in\\nreal dread of an explosion when he stood in the presence of one of the\\nmen on board.\\n\\nFor two more hours Ned Land’s rage increased. The Canadian shouted and\\npleaded, but to no avail. The sheet-iron walls were deaf. I didn’t\\nhear a single sound inside this dead-seeming boat. The vessel hadn’t\\nstirred, because I obviously would have felt its hull vibrating under\\nthe influence of the propeller. It had undoubtedly sunk into the\\nwatery deep and no longer belonged to the outside world. All this\\ndismal silence was terrifying.\\n\\nAs for our neglect, our isolation in the depths of this cell, I was\\nafraid to guess at how long it might last. Little by little, hopes I\\nhad entertained after our interview with the ship’s commander were\\nfading away. The gentleness of the man’s gaze, the generosity\\nexpressed in his facial features, the nobility of his bearing, all\\nvanished from my memory. I saw this mystifying individual anew for\\nwhat he inevitably must be: cruel and merciless. I viewed him as\\noutside humanity, beyond all feelings of compassion, the implacable\\nfoe of his fellow man, toward whom he must have sworn an undying hate!\\n\\nBut even so, was the man going to let us die of starvation, locked up\\nin this cramped prison, exposed to those horrible temptations to which\\npeople are driven by extreme hunger? This grim possibility took on a\\ndreadful intensity in my mind, and fired by my imagination, I felt an\\nunreasoning terror run through me. Conseil stayed calm. Ned Land\\nbellowed.\\n\\nJust then a noise was audible outside. Footsteps rang on the metal\\ntiling. The locks were turned, the door opened, the steward appeared.\\n\\nBefore I could make a single movement to prevent him, the Canadian\\nrushed at the poor man, threw him down, held him by the throat. The\\nsteward was choking in the grip of those powerful hands.\\n\\nConseil was already trying to loosen the harpooner’s hands from his\\nhalf-suffocated victim, and I had gone to join in the rescue, when I\\nwas abruptly nailed to the spot by these words pronounced in French:\\n\\n“Calm down, Mr. Land! And you, professor, kindly listen to me!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\nThe Man of the Waters\\n\\n\\nIT WAS THE ship’s commander who had just spoken.\\n\\nAt these words Ned Land stood up quickly. Nearly strangled, the\\nsteward staggered out at a signal from his superior; but such was the\\ncommander’s authority aboard his vessel, not one gesture gave away the\\nresentment that this man must have felt toward the Canadian. In\\nsilence we waited for the outcome of this scene; Conseil, in spite of\\nhimself, seemed almost fascinated, I was stunned.\\n\\nArms crossed, leaning against a corner of the table, the commander\\nstudied us with great care. Was he reluctant to speak further? Did he\\nregret those words he had just pronounced in French? You would have\\nthought so.\\n\\nAfter a few moments of silence, which none of us would have dreamed of\\ninterrupting:\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” he said in a calm, penetrating voice, “I speak French,\\nEnglish, German, and Latin with equal fluency. Hence I could have\\nanswered you as early as our initial interview, but first I wanted to\\nmake your acquaintance and then think things over. Your four versions\\nof the same narrative, perfectly consistent by and large, established\\nyour personal identities for me. I now know that sheer chance has\\nplaced in my presence Professor Pierre Aronnax, specialist in natural\\nhistory at the Paris Museum and entrusted with a scientific mission\\nabroad, his manservant Conseil, and Ned Land, a harpooner of Canadian\\norigin aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a frigate in the national navy of\\nthe United States of America.”\\n\\nI bowed in agreement. The commander hadn’t put a question to me. So no\\nanswer was called for. This man expressed himself with perfect ease\\nand without a trace of an accent. His phrasing was clear, his words\\nwell chosen, his facility in elocution remarkable. And yet, to me, he\\ndidn’t have “the feel” of a fellow countryman.\\n\\nHe went on with the conversation as follows:\\n\\n“No doubt, sir, you’ve felt that I waited rather too long before\\npaying you this second visit. After discovering your identities, I\\nwanted to weigh carefully what policy to pursue toward you. I had\\ngreat difficulty deciding. Some extremely inconvenient circumstances\\nhave brought you into the presence of a man who has cut himself off\\nfrom humanity. Your coming has disrupted my whole existence.”\\n\\n“Unintentionally,” I said.\\n\\n“Unintentionally?” the stranger replied, raising his voice a\\nlittle. “Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln hunted me on\\nevery sea? Was it unintentionally that you traveled aboard that\\nfrigate? Was it unintentionally that your shells bounced off my ship’s\\nhull? Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land hit me with his\\nharpoon?”\\n\\nI detected a controlled irritation in these words. But there was a\\nperfectly natural reply to these charges, and I made it.\\n\\n“Sir,” I said, “you’re surely unaware of the discussions that have\\ntaken place in Europe and America with yourself as the subject. You\\ndon’t realize that various accidents, caused by collisions with your\\nunderwater machine, have aroused public passions on those two\\ncontinents. I’ll spare you the innumerable hypotheses with which we’ve\\ntried to explain this inexplicable phenomenon, whose secret is yours\\nalone. But please understand that the Abraham Lincoln chased you over\\nthe Pacific high seas in the belief it was hunting some powerful\\nmarine monster, which had to be purged from the ocean at all cost.”\\n\\nA half smile curled the commander’s lips; then, in a calmer tone:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he replied, “do you dare claim that your frigate\\nwouldn’t have chased and cannonaded an underwater boat as readily as a\\nmonster?”\\n\\nThis question baffled me, since Commander Farragut would certainly\\nhave shown no such hesitation. He would have seen it as his sworn duty\\nto destroy a contrivance of this kind just as promptly as a gigantic\\nnarwhale.\\n\\n“So you understand, sir,” the stranger went on, “that I have a right\\nto treat you as my enemy.”\\n\\nI kept quiet, with good reason. What was the use of debating such a\\nproposition, when superior force can wipe out the best arguments?\\n\\n“It took me a good while to decide,” the commander went on. “Nothing\\nobliged me to grant you hospitality. If I were to part company with\\nyou, I’d have no personal interest in ever seeing you again. I could\\nput you back on the platform of this ship that has served as your\\nrefuge. I could sink under the sea, and I could forget you ever\\nexisted. Wouldn’t that be my right?”\\n\\n“Perhaps it would be the right of a savage,” I replied. “But not that\\nof a civilized man.”\\n\\n“Professor,” the commander replied swiftly, “I’m not what you term a\\ncivilized man! I’ve severed all ties with society, for reasons that I\\nalone have the right to appreciate. Therefore I obey none of its\\nregulations, and I insist that you never invoke them in front of me!”\\n\\nThis was plain speaking. A flash of anger and scorn lit up the\\nstranger’s eyes, and I glimpsed a fearsome past in this man’s\\nlife. Not only had he placed himself beyond human laws, he had\\nrendered himself independent, out of all reach, free in the strictest\\nsense of the word! For who would dare chase him to the depths of the\\nsea when he thwarted all attacks on the surface? What ship could\\nwithstand a collision with his underwater Monitor? What armor plate,\\nno matter how heavy, could bear the thrusts of his spur? No man among\\nmen could call him to account for his actions. God, if he believed in\\nHim, his conscience if he had one—these were the only judges to whom\\nhe was answerable.\\n\\nThese thoughts swiftly crossed my mind while this strange individual\\nfell silent, like someone completely self-absorbed. I regarded him\\nwith a mixture of fear and fascination, in the same way, no doubt,\\nthat Oedipus regarded the Sphinx.\\n\\nAfter a fairly long silence, the commander went on with our\\nconversation.\\n\\n“So I had difficulty deciding,” he said. “But I concluded that my\\npersonal interests could be reconciled with that natural compassion to\\nwhich every human being has a right. Since fate has brought you here,\\nyou’ll stay aboard my vessel. You’ll be free here, and in exchange for\\nthat freedom, moreover totally related to it, I’ll lay on you just one\\ncondition. Your word that you’ll submit to it will be sufficient.”\\n\\n“Go on, sir,” I replied. “I assume this condition is one an honest man\\ncan accept?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Just this. It’s possible that certain unforeseen events may\\nforce me to confine you to your cabins for some hours, or even for\\nsome days as the case may be. Since I prefer never to use violence, I\\nexpect from you in such a case, even more than in any other, your\\nunquestioning obedience. By acting in this way, I shield you from\\ncomplicity, I absolve you of all responsibility, since I myself make\\nit impossible for you to see what you aren’t meant to see. Do you\\naccept this condition?”\\n\\nSo things happened on board that were quite odd to say the least,\\nthings never to be seen by people not placing themselves beyond\\nsociety’s laws! Among all the surprises the future had in store for\\nme, this would not be the mildest.\\n\\n“We accept,” I replied. “Only, I’ll ask your permission, sir, to\\naddress a question to you, just one.”\\n\\n“Go ahead, sir.”\\n\\n“You said we’d be free aboard your vessel?”\\n\\n“Completely.”\\n\\n“Then I would ask what you mean by this freedom.”\\n\\n“Why, the freedom to come, go, see, and even closely observe\\neverything happening here—except under certain rare circumstances—in\\nshort, the freedom we ourselves enjoy, my companions and I.”\\n\\nIt was obvious that we did not understand each other.\\n\\n“Pardon me, sir,” I went on, “but that’s merely the freedom that every\\nprisoner has, the freedom to pace his cell! That’s not enough for us.”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, it will have to do!”\\n\\n“What! We must give up seeing our homeland, friends, and relatives\\never again?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. But giving up that intolerable earthly yoke that some men\\ncall freedom is perhaps less painful than you think!”\\n\\n“By thunder!” Ned Land shouted. “I’ll never promise I won’t try\\ngetting out of here!”\\n\\n“I didn’t ask for such a promise, Mr. Land,” the commander replied\\ncoldly.\\n\\n“Sir,” I replied, flaring up in spite of myself, “you’re taking unfair\\nadvantage of us! This is sheer cruelty!”\\n\\n“No, sir, it’s an act of mercy! You’re my prisoners of war! I’ve cared\\nfor you when, with a single word, I could plunge you back into the\\nocean depths! You attacked me! You’ve just stumbled on a secret no\\nliving man must probe, the secret of my entire existence! Do you think\\nI’ll send you back to a world that must know nothing more of me?\\nNever! By keeping you on board, it isn’t you whom I care for, it’s\\nme!”\\n\\nThese words indicated that the commander pursued a policy impervious\\nto arguments.\\n\\n“Then, sir,” I went on, “you give us, quite simply, a choice between\\nlife and death?”\\n\\n“Quite simply.”\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “to a question couched in these terms, our\\nanswer can be taken for granted. But no solemn promises bind us to the\\ncommander of this vessel.”\\n\\n“None, sir,” the stranger replied.\\n\\nThen, in a gentler voice, he went on:\\n\\n“Now, allow me to finish what I have to tell you. I’ve heard of you,\\nProfessor Aronnax. You, if not your companions, won’t perhaps complain\\ntoo much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together. Among\\nthe books that make up my favorite reading, you’ll find the work\\nyou’ve published on the great ocean depths. I’ve pored over it. You’ve\\ntaken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go. But you don’t\\nknow everything because you haven’t seen everything. Let me tell you,\\nprofessor, you won’t regret the time you spend aboard my\\nvessel. You’re going to voyage through a land of wonders. Stunned\\namazement will probably be your habitual state of mind. It will be a\\nlong while before you tire of the sights constantly before your\\neyes. I’m going to make another underwater tour of the world—perhaps\\nmy last, who knows?—and I’ll review everything I’ve studied in the\\ndepths of these seas that I’ve crossed so often, and you can be my\\nfellow student. Starting this very day, you’ll enter a new element,\\nyou’ll see what no human being has ever seen before—since my men and I\\nno longer count—and thanks to me, you’re going to learn the ultimate\\nsecrets of our planet.”\\n\\nI can’t deny it; the commander’s words had a tremendous effect on\\nme. He had caught me on my weak side, and I momentarily forgot that\\nnot even this sublime experience was worth the loss of my\\nfreedom. Besides, I counted on the future to resolve this important\\nquestion. So I was content to reply:\\n\\n“Sir, even though you’ve cut yourself off from humanity, I can see\\nthat you haven’t disowned all human feeling. We’re castaways whom\\nyou’ve charitably taken aboard, we’ll never forget that. Speaking for\\nmyself, I don’t rule out that the interests of science could override\\neven the need for freedom, which promises me that, in exchange, our\\nencounter will provide great rewards.”\\n\\nI thought the commander would offer me his hand, to seal our\\nagreement. He did nothing of the sort. I regretted that.\\n\\n“One last question,” I said, just as this inexplicable being seemed\\nready to withdraw.\\n\\n“Ask it, professor.”\\n\\n“By what name am I to call you?”\\n\\n“Sir,” the commander replied, “to you, I’m simply Captain Nemo;* to\\nme, you and your companions are simply passengers on the Nautilus.”\\n\\n*Latin: nemo means “no one.” Ed.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo called out. A steward appeared. The captain gave him his\\norders in that strange language I couldn’t even identify. Then,\\nturning to the Canadian and Conseil:\\n\\n“A meal is waiting for you in your cabin,” he told them. “Kindly\\nfollow this man.”\\n\\n“That’s an offer I can’t refuse!” the harpooner replied.\\n\\nAfter being confined for over thirty hours, he and Conseil were\\nfinally out of this cell.\\n\\n“And now, Professor Aronnax, our own breakfast is ready. Allow me to\\nlead the way.”\\n\\n“Yours to command, captain.”\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo, and as soon as I passed through the doorway,\\nI went down a kind of electrically lit passageway that resembled a\\ngangway on a ship. After a stretch of some ten meters, a second door\\nopened before me.\\n\\nI then entered a dining room, decorated and furnished in austere good\\ntaste. Inlaid with ebony trim, tall oaken sideboards stood at both\\nends of this room, and sparkling on their shelves were staggered rows\\nof earthenware, porcelain, and glass of incalculable value. There\\nsilver-plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light\\nfixtures in the ceiling, whose glare was softened and tempered by\\ndelicately painted designs.\\n\\nIn the center of this room stood a table, richly spread. Captain Nemo\\nindicated the place I was to occupy.\\n\\n“Be seated,” he told me, “and eat like the famished man you must be.”\\n\\nOur breakfast consisted of several dishes whose contents were all\\nsupplied by the sea, and some foods whose nature and derivation were\\nunknown to me. They were good, I admit, but with a peculiar flavor to\\nwhich I would soon grow accustomed. These various food items seemed to\\nbe rich in phosphorous, and I thought that they, too, must have been\\nof marine origin.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stared at me. I had asked him nothing, but he read my\\nthoughts, and on his own he answered the questions I was itching to\\naddress him.\\n\\n“Most of these dishes are new to you,” he told me. “But you can\\nconsume them without fear. They’re healthy and nourishing. I renounced\\nterrestrial foods long ago, and I’m none the worse for it. My crew are\\nstrong and full of energy, and they eat what I eat.”\\n\\n“So,” I said, “all these foods are products of the sea?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor, the sea supplies all my needs. Sometimes I cast my\\nnets in our wake, and I pull them up ready to burst. Sometimes I go\\nhunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far\\nout of man’s reach, and I corner the game that dwells in my underwater\\nforests. Like the flocks of old Proteus, King Neptune’s shepherd, my\\nherds graze without fear on the ocean’s immense prairies. There I own\\nvast properties that I harvest myself, and which are forever sown by\\nthe hand of the Creator of All Things.”\\n\\nI stared at Captain Nemo in definite astonishment, and I answered him:\\n\\n“Sir, I understand perfectly how your nets can furnish excellent fish\\nfor your table; I understand less how you can chase aquatic game in\\nyour underwater forests; but how a piece of red meat, no matter how\\nsmall, can figure in your menu, that I don’t understand at all.”\\n\\n“Nor I, sir,” Captain Nemo answered me. “I never touch the flesh of\\nland animals.”\\n\\n“Nevertheless, this . . . ,” I went on, pointing to a dish where some\\nslices of loin were still left.\\n\\n“What you believe to be red meat, professor, is nothing other than\\nloin of sea turtle. Similarly, here are some dolphin livers you might\\nmistake for stewed pork. My chef is a skillful food processor who\\nexcels at pickling and preserving these various exhibits from the\\nocean. Feel free to sample all of these foods. Here are some preserves\\nof sea cucumber that a Malaysian would declare to be unrivaled in the\\nentire world, here’s cream from milk furnished by the udders of\\ncetaceans, and sugar from the huge fucus plants in the North Sea; and\\nfinally, allow me to offer you some marmalade of sea anemone, equal to\\nthat from the tastiest fruits.”\\n\\nSo I sampled away, more as a curiosity seeker than an epicure, while\\nCaptain Nemo delighted me with his incredible anecdotes.\\n\\n“But this sea, Professor Aronnax,” he told me, “this prodigious,\\ninexhaustible wet nurse of a sea not only feeds me, she dresses me as\\nwell. That fabric covering you was woven from the masses of filaments\\nthat anchor certain seashells; as the ancients were wont to do, it was\\ndyed with purple ink from the murex snail and shaded with violet tints\\nthat I extract from a marine slug, the Mediterranean sea hare. The\\nperfumes you’ll find on the washstand in your cabin were produced from\\nthe oozings of marine plants. Your mattress was made from the ocean’s\\nsoftest eelgrass. Your quill pen will be whalebone, your ink a juice\\nsecreted by cuttlefish or squid. Everything comes to me from the sea,\\njust as someday everything will return to it!”\\n\\n“You love the sea, captain.”\\n\\n“Yes, I love it! The sea is the be all and end all! It covers\\nseven-tenths of the planet earth. Its breath is clean and\\nhealthy. It’s an immense wilderness where a man is never lonely,\\nbecause he feels life astir on every side. The sea is simply the\\nvehicle for a prodigious, unearthly mode of existence; it’s simply\\nmovement and love; it’s living infinity, as one of your poets put\\nit. And in essence, professor, nature is here made manifest by all\\nthree of her kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and animal. The last of\\nthese is amply represented by the four zoophyte groups, three classes\\nof articulates, five classes of mollusks, and three vertebrate\\nclasses: mammals, reptiles, and those countless legions of fish, an\\ninfinite order of animals totaling more than 13,000 species, of which\\nonly one-tenth belong to fresh water. The sea is a vast pool of\\nnature. Our globe began with the sea, so to speak, and who can say we\\nwon’t end with it! Here lies supreme tranquility. The sea doesn’t\\nbelong to tyrants. On its surface they can still exercise their\\niniquitous claims, battle each other, devour each other, haul every\\nearthly horror. But thirty feet below sea level, their dominion\\nceases, their influence fades, their power vanishes! Ah, sir, live!\\nLive in the heart of the seas! Here alone lies independence! Here I\\nrecognize no superiors! Here I’m free!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo suddenly fell silent in the midst of this enthusiastic\\noutpouring. Had he let himself get carried away, past the bounds of\\nhis habitual reserve? Had he said too much? For a few moments he\\nstrolled up and down, all aquiver. Then his nerves grew calmer, his\\nfacial features recovered their usual icy composure, and turning to\\nme:\\n\\n“Now, professor,” he said, “if you’d like to inspect the Nautilus, I’m\\nyours to command.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\nThe Nautilus\\n\\n\\nCAPTAIN NEMO stood up. I followed him. Contrived at the rear of the\\ndining room, a double door opened, and I entered a room whose\\ndimensions equaled the one I had just left.\\n\\nIt was a library. Tall, black-rosewood bookcases, inlaid with\\ncopperwork, held on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly\\nbound books. These furnishings followed the contours of the room,\\ntheir lower parts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon\\nleather and curved for maximum comfort. Light, movable reading stands,\\nwhich could be pushed away or pulled near as desired, allowed books to\\nbe positioned on them for easy study. In the center stood a huge table\\ncovered with pamphlets, among which some newspapers, long out of date,\\nwere visible. Electric light flooded this whole harmonious totality,\\nfalling from four frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the\\nceiling. I stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously\\nlaid out, and I couldn’t believe my eyes.\\n\\n“Captain Nemo,” I told my host, who had just stretched out on a couch,\\n“this is a library that would do credit to more than one continental\\npalace, and I truly marvel to think it can go with you into the\\ndeepest seas.”\\n\\n“Where could one find greater silence or solitude, professor?” Captain\\nNemo replied. “Did your study at the museum afford you such a perfect\\nretreat?”\\n\\n“No, sir, and I might add that it’s quite a humble one next to\\nyours. You own 6,000 or 7,000 volumes here . . .”\\n\\n“12,000, Professor Aronnax. They’re my sole remaining ties with dry\\nland. But I was done with the shore the day my Nautilus submerged for\\nthe first time under the waters. That day I purchased my last volumes,\\nmy last pamphlets, my last newspapers, and ever since I’ve chosen to\\nbelieve that humanity no longer thinks or writes. In any event,\\nprofessor, these books are at your disposal, and you may use them\\nfreely.”\\n\\nI thanked Captain Nemo and approached the shelves of this\\nlibrary. Written in every language, books on science, ethics, and\\nliterature were there in abundance, but I didn’t see a single work on\\neconomics—they seemed to be strictly banned on board. One odd detail:\\nall these books were shelved indiscriminately without regard to the\\nlanguage in which they were written, and this jumble proved that the\\nNautilus’s captain could read fluently whatever volumes he chanced to\\npick up.\\n\\nAmong these books I noted masterpieces by the greats of ancient and\\nmodern times, in other words, all of humanity’s finest achievements in\\nhistory, poetry, fiction, and science, from Homer to Victor Hugo, from\\nXenophon to Michelet, from Rabelais to Madame George Sand. But\\nscience, in particular, represented the major investment of this\\nlibrary: books on mechanics, ballistics, hydrography, meteorology,\\ngeography, geology, etc., held a place there no less important than\\nworks on natural history, and I realized that they made up the\\ncaptain’s chief reading. There I saw the complete works of Humboldt,\\nthe complete Arago, as well as works by Foucault, Henri Sainte-Claire\\nDeville, Chasles, Milne-Edwards, Quatrefages, John Tyndall, Faraday,\\nBerthelot, Father Secchi, Petermann, Commander Maury, Louis Agassiz,\\netc., plus the transactions of France’s Academy of Sciences, bulletins\\nfrom the various geographical societies, etc., and in a prime\\nlocation, those two volumes on the great ocean depths that had perhaps\\nearned me this comparatively charitable welcome from Captain\\nNemo. Among the works of Joseph Bertrand, his book entitled The\\nFounders of Astronomy even gave me a definite date; and since I knew\\nit had appeared in the course of 1865, I concluded that the fitting\\nout of the Nautilus hadn’t taken place before then. Accordingly, three\\nyears ago at the most, Captain Nemo had begun his underwater\\nexistence. Moreover, I hoped some books even more recent would permit\\nme to pinpoint the date precisely; but I had plenty of time to look\\nfor them, and I didn’t want to put off any longer our stroll through\\nthe wonders of the Nautilus.\\n\\n“Sir,” I told the captain, “thank you for placing this library at my\\ndisposal. There are scientific treasures here, and I’ll take advantage\\nof them.”\\n\\n“This room isn’t only a library,” Captain Nemo said, “it’s also a\\nsmoking room.”\\n\\n“A smoking room?” I exclaimed. “Then one may smoke on board?”\\n\\n“Surely.”\\n\\n“In that case, sir, I’m forced to believe that you’ve kept up\\nrelations with Havana.”\\n\\n“None whatever,” the captain replied. “Try this cigar, Professor\\nAronnax, and even though it doesn’t come from Havana, it will satisfy\\nyou if you’re a connoisseur.”\\n\\nI took the cigar offered me, whose shape recalled those from Cuba; but\\nit seemed to be made of gold leaf. I lit it at a small brazier\\nsupported by an elegant bronze stand, and I inhaled my first whiffs\\nwith the relish of a smoker who hasn’t had a puff in days.\\n\\n“It’s excellent,” I said, “but it’s not from the tobacco plant.”\\n\\n“Right,” the captain replied, “this tobacco comes from neither Havana\\nnor the Orient. It’s a kind of nicotine-rich seaweed that the ocean\\nsupplies me, albeit sparingly. Do you still miss your Cubans, sir?”\\n\\n“Captain, I scorn them from this day forward.”\\n\\n“Then smoke these cigars whenever you like, without debating their\\norigin. They bear no government seal of approval, but I imagine\\nthey’re none the worse for it.”\\n\\n“On the contrary.”\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo opened a door facing the one by which I had\\nentered the library, and I passed into an immense, splendidly lit\\nlounge.\\n\\nIt was a huge quadrilateral with canted corners, ten meters long, six\\nwide, five high. A luminous ceiling, decorated with delicate\\narabesques, distributed a soft, clear daylight over all the wonders\\ngathered in this museum. For a museum it truly was, in which clever\\nhands had spared no expense to amass every natural and artistic\\ntreasure, displaying them with the helter-skelter picturesqueness that\\ndistinguishes a painter’s studio.\\n\\nSome thirty pictures by the masters, uniformly framed and separated by\\ngleaming panoplies of arms, adorned walls on which were stretched\\ntapestries of austere design. There I saw canvases of the highest\\nvalue, the likes of which I had marveled at in private European\\ncollections and art exhibitions. The various schools of the old\\nmasters were represented by a Raphael Madonna, a Virgin by Leonardo da\\nVinci, a nymph by Correggio, a woman by Titian, an adoration of the\\nMagi by Veronese, an assumption of the Virgin by Murillo, a Holbein\\nportrait, a monk by Velazquez, a martyr by Ribera, a village fair by\\nRubens, two Flemish landscapes by Teniers, three little genre\\npaintings by Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter, two canvases by\\nGericault and Prud’hon, plus seascapes by Backhuysen and Vernet. Among\\nthe works of modern art were pictures signed by Delacroix, Ingres,\\nDecamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny, etc., and some wonderful\\nminiature statues in marble or bronze, modeled after antiquity’s\\nfinest originals, stood on their pedestals in the corners of this\\nmagnificent museum. As the Nautilus’s commander had predicted, my mind\\nwas already starting to fall into that promised state of stunned\\namazement.\\n\\n“Professor,” this strange man then said, “you must excuse the\\ninformality with which I receive you, and the disorder reigning in\\nthis lounge.”\\n\\n“Sir,” I replied, “without prying into who you are, might I venture to\\nidentify you as an artist?”\\n\\n“A collector, sir, nothing more. Formerly I loved acquiring these\\nbeautiful works created by the hand of man. I sought them greedily,\\nferreted them out tirelessly, and I’ve been able to gather some\\nobjects of great value. They’re my last mementos of those shores that\\nare now dead for me. In my eyes, your modern artists are already as\\nold as the ancients. They’ve existed for 2,000 or 3,000 years, and I\\nmix them up in my mind. The masters are ageless.”\\n\\n“What about these composers?” I said, pointing to sheet music by\\nWeber, Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Hérold, Wagner,\\nAuber, Gounod, Victor Massé, and a number of others scattered over a\\nfull size piano-organ, which occupied one of the wall panels in this\\nlounge.\\n\\n“These composers,” Captain Nemo answered me, “are the contemporaries\\nof Orpheus, because in the annals of the dead, all chronological\\ndifferences fade; and I’m dead, professor, quite as dead as those\\nfriends of yours sleeping six feet under!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo fell silent and seemed lost in reverie. I regarded him\\nwith intense excitement, silently analyzing his strange facial\\nexpression. Leaning his elbow on the corner of a valuable mosaic\\ntable, he no longer saw me, he had forgotten my very presence.\\n\\nI didn’t disturb his meditations but continued to pass in review the\\ncuriosities that enriched this lounge.\\n\\nAfter the works of art, natural rarities predominated. They consisted\\nchiefly of plants, shells, and other exhibits from the ocean that must\\nhave been Captain Nemo’s own personal finds. In the middle of the\\nlounge, a jet of water, electrically lit, fell back into a basin made\\nfrom a single giant clam. The delicately festooned rim of this shell,\\nsupplied by the biggest mollusk in the class Acephala, measured about\\nsix meters in circumference; so it was even bigger than those fine\\ngiant clams given to King Franτois I by the Republic of Venice, and\\nwhich the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris has made into two gigantic\\nholy-water fonts.\\n\\nAround this basin, inside elegant glass cases fastened with copper\\nbands, there were classified and labeled the most valuable marine\\nexhibits ever put before the eyes of a naturalist. My professorial\\nglee may easily be imagined.\\n\\nThe zoophyte branch offered some very unusual specimens from its two\\ngroups, the polyps and the echinoderms. In the first group: organ-pipe\\ncoral, gorgonian coral arranged into fan shapes, soft sponges from\\nSyria, isis coral from the Molucca Islands, sea-pen coral, wonderful\\ncoral of the genus Virgularia from the waters of Norway, various coral\\nof the genus Umbellularia, alcyonarian coral, then a whole series of\\nthose madrepores that my mentor Professor Milne-Edwards has so\\nshrewdly classified into divisions and among which I noted the\\nwonderful genus Flabellina as well as the genus Oculina from RΘunion\\nIsland, plus a “Neptune’s chariot” from the Caribbean Sea—every superb\\nvariety of coral, and in short, every species of these unusual\\npolyparies that congregate to form entire islands that will one day\\nturn into continents. Among the echinoderms, notable for being covered\\nwith spines: starfish, feather stars, sea lilies, free-swimming\\ncrinoids, brittle stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, etc., represented\\na complete collection of the individuals in this group.\\n\\nAn excitable conchologist would surely have fainted dead away before\\nother, more numerous glass cases in which were classified specimens\\nfrom the mollusk branch. There I saw a collection of incalculable\\nvalue that I haven’t time to describe completely. Among these exhibits\\nI’ll mention, just for the record: an elegant royal hammer shell from\\nthe Indian Ocean, whose evenly spaced white spots stood out sharply\\nagainst a base of red and brown; an imperial spiny oyster, brightly\\ncolored, bristling with thorns, a specimen rare to European museums,\\nwhose value I estimated at 20,000 francs; a common hammer shell from\\nthe seas near Queensland, very hard to come by; exotic cockles from\\nSenegal, fragile white bivalve shells that a single breath could pop\\nlike a soap bubble; several varieties of watering-pot shell from Java,\\na sort of limestone tube fringed with leafy folds and much fought over\\nby collectors; a whole series of top-shell snails—greenish yellow ones\\nfished up from American seas, others colored reddish brown that\\npatronize the waters off Queensland, the former coming from the Gulf\\nof Mexico and notable for their overlapping shells, the latter some\\nsun-carrier shells found in the southernmost seas, finally and rarest\\nof all, the magnificent spurred-star shell from New Zealand; then some\\nwonderful peppery-furrow shells; several valuable species of cythera\\nclams and venus clams; the trellis wentletrap snail from Tranquebar on\\nIndia’s eastern shore; a marbled turban snail gleaming with\\nmother-of-pearl; green parrot shells from the seas of China; the\\nvirtually unknown cone snail from the genus Coenodullus; every variety\\nof cowry used as money in India and Africa; a “glory-of-the-seas,” the\\nmost valuable shell in the East Indies; finally, common periwinkles,\\ndelphinula snails, turret snails, violet snails, European cowries,\\nvolute snails, olive shells, miter shells, helmet shells, murex\\nsnails, whelks, harp shells, spiky periwinkles, triton snails, horn\\nshells, spindle shells, conch shells, spider conchs, limpets, glass\\nsnails, sea butterflies—every kind of delicate, fragile seashell that\\nscience has baptized with its most delightful names.\\n\\nAside and in special compartments, strings of supremely beautiful\\npearls were spread out, the electric light flecking them with little\\nfiery sparks: pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan shells in the Red\\nSea; green pearls from the rainbow abalone; yellow, blue, and black\\npearls, the unusual handiwork of various mollusks from every ocean and\\nof certain mussels from rivers up north; in short, several specimens\\nof incalculable worth that had been oozed by the rarest of\\nshellfish. Some of these pearls were bigger than a pigeon egg; they\\nmore than equaled the one that the explorer Tavernier sold the Shah of\\nPersia for 3,000,000 francs, and they surpassed that other pearl owned\\nby the Imam of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivaled in the\\nentire world.\\n\\nConsequently, to calculate the value of this collection was, I should\\nsay, impossible. Captain Nemo must have spent millions in acquiring\\nthese different specimens, and I was wondering what financial\\nresources he tapped to satisfy his collector’s fancies, when these\\nwords interrupted me:\\n\\n“You’re examining my shells, professor? They’re indeed able to\\nfascinate a naturalist; but for me they have an added charm, since\\nI’ve collected every one of them with my own two hands, and not a sea\\non the globe has escaped my investigations.”\\n\\n“I understand, captain, I understand your delight at strolling in the\\nmidst of this wealth. You’re a man who gathers his treasure in\\nperson. No museum in Europe owns such a collection of exhibits from\\nthe ocean. But if I exhaust all my wonderment on them, I’ll have\\nnothing left for the ship that carries them! I have absolutely no wish\\nto probe those secrets of yours! But I confess that my curiosity is\\naroused to the limit by this Nautilus, the motor power it contains,\\nthe equipment enabling it to operate, the ultra powerful force that\\nbrings it to life. I see some instruments hanging on the walls of this\\nlounge whose purposes are unknown to me. May I learn—”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo answered me, “I’ve said you’d be\\nfree aboard my vessel, so no part of the Nautilus is off-limits to\\nyou. You may inspect it in detail, and I’ll be delighted to act as\\nyour guide.”\\n\\n“I don’t know how to thank you, sir, but I won’t abuse your good\\nnature. I would only ask you about the uses intended for these\\ninstruments of physical measure—”\\n\\n“Professor, these same instruments are found in my stateroom, where\\nI’ll have the pleasure of explaining their functions to you. But\\nbeforehand, come inspect the cabin set aside for you. You need to\\nlearn how you’ll be lodged aboard the Nautilus.”\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo, who, via one of the doors cut into the\\nlounge’s canted corners, led me back down the ship’s gangways. He took\\nme to the bow, and there I found not just a cabin but an elegant\\nstateroom with a bed, a washstand, and various other furnishings.\\n\\nI could only thank my host.\\n\\n“Your stateroom adjoins mine,” he told me, opening a door, “and mine\\nleads into that lounge we’ve just left.”\\n\\nI entered the captain’s stateroom. It had an austere, almost monastic\\nappearance. An iron bedstead, a worktable, some washstand\\nfixtures. Subdued lighting. No luxuries. Just the bare necessities.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo showed me to a bench.\\n\\n“Kindly be seated,” he told me.\\n\\nI sat, and he began speaking as follows:\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\nEverything through Electricity\\n\\n\\n“SIR,” CAPTAIN NEMO SAID, showing me the instruments hanging on the\\nwalls of his stateroom, “these are the devices needed to navigate the\\nNautilus. Here, as in the lounge, I always have them before my eyes,\\nand they indicate my position and exact heading in the midst of the\\nocean. You’re familiar with some of them, such as the thermometer,\\nwhich gives the temperature inside the Nautilus; the barometer, which\\nmeasures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes in the\\nweather; the humidistat, which indicates the degree of dryness in the\\natmosphere; the storm glass, whose mixture decomposes to foretell the\\narrival of tempests; the compass, which steers my course; the sextant,\\nwhich takes the sun’s altitude and tells me my latitude; chronometers,\\nwhich allow me to calculate my longitude; and finally, spyglasses for\\nboth day and night, enabling me to scrutinize every point of the\\nhorizon once the Nautilus has risen to the surface of the waves.”\\n\\n“These are the normal navigational instruments,” I replied, “and I’m\\nfamiliar with their uses. But no doubt these others answer pressing\\nneeds unique to the Nautilus. That dial I see there, with the needle\\nmoving across it—isn’t it a pressure gauge?”\\n\\n“It is indeed a pressure gauge. It’s placed in contact with the water,\\nand it indicates the outside pressure on our hull, which in turn gives\\nme the depth at which my submersible is sitting.”\\n\\n“And these are some new breed of sounding line?”\\n\\n“They’re thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures in\\nthe different strata.”\\n\\n“And these other instruments, whose functions I can’t even guess?”\\n\\n“Here, professor, I need to give you some background information,”\\nCaptain Nemo said. “So kindly hear me out.”\\n\\nHe fell silent for some moments, then he said:\\n\\n“There’s a powerful, obedient, swift, and effortless force that can be\\nbent to any use and which reigns supreme aboard my vessel. It does\\neverything. It lights me, it warms me, it’s the soul of my mechanical\\nequipment. This force is electricity.”\\n\\n“Electricity!” I exclaimed in some surprise.\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“But, captain, you have a tremendous speed of movement that doesn’t\\nsquare with the strength of electricity. Until now, its dynamic\\npotential has remained quite limited, capable of producing only small\\namounts of power!”\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo replied, “my electricity isn’t the\\nrun-of-the-mill variety, and with your permission, I’ll leave it at\\nthat.”\\n\\n“I won’t insist, sir, and I’ll rest content with simply being\\nflabbergasted at your results. I would ask one question, however,\\nwhich you needn’t answer if it’s indiscreet. The electric cells you\\nuse to generate this marvelous force must be depleted very\\nquickly. Their zinc component, for example: how do you replace it,\\nsince you no longer stay in contact with the shore?”\\n\\n“That question deserves an answer,” Captain Nemo replied. “First off,\\nI’ll mention that at the bottom of the sea there exist veins of zinc,\\niron, silver, and gold whose mining would quite certainly be\\nfeasible. But I’ve tapped none of these land-based metals, and I\\nwanted to make demands only on the sea itself for the sources of my\\nelectricity.”\\n\\n“The sea itself?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor, and there was no shortage of such sources. In fact,\\nby establishing a circuit between two wires immersed to different\\ndepths, I’d be able to obtain electricity through the diverging\\ntemperatures they experience; but I preferred to use a more practical\\nprocedure.”\\n\\n“And that is?”\\n\\n“You’re familiar with the composition of salt water. In 1,000 grams\\none finds 96.5% water and about 2.66% sodium chloride; then small\\nquantities of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium\\nbromide, sulfate of magnesia, calcium sulfate, and calcium\\ncarbonate. Hence you observe that sodium chloride is encountered there\\nin significant proportions. Now then, it’s this sodium that I extract\\nfrom salt water and with which I compose my electric cells.”\\n\\n“Sodium?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Mixed with mercury, it forms an amalgam that takes the\\nplace of zinc in Bunsen cells. The mercury is never depleted. Only the\\nsodium is consumed, and the sea itself gives me that. Beyond this,\\nI’ll mention that sodium batteries have been found to generate the\\ngreater energy, and their electro-motor strength is twice that of zinc\\nbatteries.”\\n\\n“Captain, I fully understand the excellence of sodium under the\\nconditions in which you’re placed. The sea contains it. Fine. But it\\nstill has to be produced, in short, extracted. And how do you\\naccomplish this? Obviously your batteries could do the extracting; but\\nif I’m not mistaken, the consumption of sodium needed by your electric\\nequipment would be greater than the quantity you’d extract. It would\\ncome about, then, that in the process of producing your sodium, you’d\\nuse up more than you’d make!”\\n\\n“Accordingly, professor, I don’t extract it with batteries; quite\\nsimply, I utilize the heat of coal from the earth.”\\n\\n“From the earth?” I said, my voice going up on the word.\\n\\n“We’ll say coal from the seafloor, if you prefer,” Captain Nemo\\nreplied.\\n\\n“And you can mine these veins of underwater coal?”\\n\\n“You’ll watch me work them, Professor Aronnax. I ask only a little\\npatience of you, since you’ll have ample time to be patient. Just\\nremember one thing: I owe everything to the ocean; it generates\\nelectricity, and electricity gives the Nautilus heat, light, motion,\\nand, in a word, life itself.”\\n\\n“But not the air you breathe?”\\n\\n“Oh, I could produce the air needed on board, but it would be\\npointless, since I can rise to the surface of the sea whenever I\\nlike. However, even though electricity doesn’t supply me with\\nbreathable air, it at least operates the powerful pumps that store it\\nunder pressure in special tanks; which, if need be, allows me to\\nextend my stay in the lower strata for as long as I want.”\\n\\n“Captain,” I replied, “I’ll rest content with marveling. You’ve\\nobviously found what all mankind will surely find one day, the true\\ndynamic power of electricity.”\\n\\n“I’m not so certain they’ll find it,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “But\\nbe that as it may, you’re already familiar with the first use I’ve\\nfound for this valuable force. It lights us, and with a uniformity and\\ncontinuity not even possessed by sunlight. Now, look at that clock:\\nit’s electric, it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest\\nchronometers. I’ve had it divided into twenty-four hours like Italian\\nclocks, since neither day nor night, sun nor moon, exist for me, but\\nonly this artificial light that I import into the depths of the seas!\\nSee, right now it’s ten o’clock in the morning.”\\n\\n“That’s perfect.”\\n\\n“Another use for electricity: that dial hanging before our eyes\\nindicates how fast the Nautilus is going. An electric wire puts it in\\ncontact with the patent log; this needle shows me the actual speed of\\nmy submersible. And . . . hold on . . . just now we’re proceeding at\\nthe moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour.”\\n\\n“It’s marvelous,” I replied, “and I truly see, captain, how right you\\nare to use this force; it’s sure to take the place of wind, water, and\\nsteam.”\\n\\n“But that’s not all, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo said, standing\\nup. “And if you’d care to follow me, we’ll inspect the Nautilus’s\\nstern.”\\n\\nIn essence, I was already familiar with the whole forward part of this\\nunderwater boat, and here are its exact subdivisions going from\\namidships to its spur: the dining room, 5 meters long and separated\\nfrom the library by a watertight bulkhead, in other words, it couldn’t\\nbe penetrated by the sea; the library, 5 meters long; the main lounge,\\n10 meters long, separated from the captain’s stateroom by a second\\nwatertight bulkhead; the aforesaid stateroom, 5 meters long; mine, 2.5\\nmeters long; and finally, air tanks 7.5 meters long and extending to\\nthe stempost. Total: a length of 35 meters. Doors were cut into the\\nwatertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically by means of\\nindia-rubber seals, which insured complete safety aboard the Nautilus\\nin the event of a leak in any one section.\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo down gangways located for easy transit, and I\\narrived amidships. There I found a sort of shaft heading upward\\nbetween two watertight bulkheads. An iron ladder, clamped to the wall,\\nled to the shaft’s upper end. I asked the captain what this ladder was\\nfor.\\n\\n“It goes to the skiff,” he replied.\\n\\n“What! You have a skiff?” I replied in some astonishment.\\n\\n“Surely. An excellent longboat, light and unsinkable, which is used\\nfor excursions and fishing trips.”\\n\\n“But when you want to set out, don’t you have to return to the surface\\nof the sea?”\\n\\n“By no means. The skiff is attached to the topside of the Nautilus’s\\nhull and is set in a cavity expressly designed to receive it. It’s\\ncompletely decked over, absolutely watertight, and held solidly in\\nplace by bolts. This ladder leads to a manhole cut into the Nautilus’s\\nhull and corresponding to a comparable hole cut into the side of the\\nskiff. I insert myself through this double opening into the\\nlongboat. My crew close up the hole belonging to the Nautilus; I close\\nup the one belonging to the skiff, simply by screwing it into place. I\\nundo the bolts holding the skiff to the submersible, and the longboat\\nrises with prodigious speed to the surface of the sea. I then open the\\ndeck paneling, carefully closed until that point; I up mast and hoist\\nsail—or I take out my oars—and I go for a spin.”\\n\\n“But how do you return to the ship?”\\n\\n“I don’t, Professor Aronnax; the Nautilus returns to me.”\\n\\n“At your command?”\\n\\n“At my command. An electric wire connects me to the ship. I fire off a\\ntelegram, and that’s that.”\\n\\n“Right,” I said, tipsy from all these wonders, “nothing to it!”\\n\\nAfter passing the well of the companionway that led to the platform, I\\nsaw a cabin 2 meters long in which Conseil and Ned Land, enraptured\\nwith their meal, were busy devouring it to the last crumb. Then a door\\nopened into the galley, 3 meters long and located between the vessel’s\\nhuge storage lockers.\\n\\nThere, even more powerful and obedient than gas, electricity did most\\nof the cooking. Arriving under the stoves, wires transmitted to\\nplatinum griddles a heat that was distributed and sustained with\\nperfect consistency. It also heated a distilling mechanism that, via\\nevaporation, supplied excellent drinking water. Next to this galley\\nwas a bathroom, conveniently laid out, with faucets supplying hot or\\ncold water at will.\\n\\nAfter the galley came the crew’s quarters, 5 meters long. But the door\\nwas closed and I couldn’t see its accommodations, which might have\\ntold me the number of men it took to operate the Nautilus.\\n\\nAt the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead, separating the\\ncrew’s quarters from the engine room. A door opened, and I stood in\\nthe compartment where Captain Nemo, indisputably a world-class\\nengineer, had set up his locomotive equipment.\\n\\nBrightly lit, the engine room measured at least 20 meters in\\nlength. It was divided, by function, into two parts: the first\\ncontained the cells for generating electricity, the second that\\nmechanism transmitting movement to the propeller.\\n\\nRight off, I detected an odor permeating the compartment that was sui\\ngeneris.* Captain Nemo noticed the negative impression it made on me.\\n\\n*Latin: “in a class by itself.” Ed.\\n\\n“That,” he told me, “is a gaseous discharge caused by our use of\\nsodium, but it’s only a mild inconvenience. In any event, every\\nmorning we sanitize the ship by ventilating it in the open air.”\\n\\nMeanwhile I examined the Nautilus’s engine with a fascination easy to\\nimagine.\\n\\n“You observe,” Captain Nemo told me, “that I use Bunsen cells, not\\nRuhmkorff cells. The latter would be ineffectual. One uses fewer\\nBunsen cells, but they’re big and strong, and experience has proven\\ntheir superiority. The electricity generated here makes its way to the\\nstern, where electromagnets of huge size activate a special system of\\nlevers and gears that transmit movement to the propeller’s shaft. The\\nlatter has a diameter of 6 meters, a pitch of 7.5 meters, and can do\\nup to 120 revolutions per minute.”\\n\\n“And that gives you?”\\n\\n“A speed of fifty miles per hour.”\\n\\nThere lay a mystery, but I didn’t insist on exploring it. How could\\nelectricity work with such power? Where did this nearly unlimited\\nenergy originate? Was it in the extraordinary voltage obtained from\\nsome new kind of induction coil? Could its transmission have been\\nimmeasurably increased by some unknown system of levers?** This was\\nthe point I couldn’t grasp.\\n\\n**Author’s Note: And sure enough, there’s now talk of such a\\n  discovery, in which a new set of levers generates considerable\\n  power. Did its inventor meet up with Captain Nemo?\\n\\n“Captain Nemo,” I said, “I’ll vouch for the results and not try to\\nexplain them. I’ve seen the Nautilus at work out in front of the\\nAbraham Lincoln, and I know where I stand on its speed. But it isn’t\\nenough just to move, we have to see where we’re going! We must be able\\nto steer right or left, up or down! How do you reach the lower depths,\\nwhere you meet an increasing resistance that’s assessed in hundreds of\\natmospheres? How do you rise back to the surface of the ocean?\\nFinally, how do you keep your ship at whatever level suits you? Am I\\nindiscreet in asking you all these things?”\\n\\n“Not at all, professor,” the captain answered me after a slight\\nhesitation, “since you’ll never leave this underwater boat. Come into\\nthe lounge. It’s actually our work room, and there you’ll learn the\\nfull story about the Nautilus!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nSome Figures\\n\\n\\nA MOMENT LATER we were seated on a couch in the lounge, cigars between\\nour lips. The captain placed before my eyes a working drawing that\\ngave the ground plan, cross section, and side view of the\\nNautilus. Then he began his description as follows:\\n\\n“Here, Professor Aronnax, are the different dimensions of this boat\\nnow transporting you. It’s a very long cylinder with conical ends. It\\nnoticeably takes the shape of a cigar, a shape already adopted in\\nLondon for several projects of the same kind. The length of this\\ncylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters, and its maximum\\nbreadth of beam is eight meters. So it isn’t quite built on the\\nten-to-one ratio of your high-speed steamers; but its lines are\\nsufficiently long, and their tapering gradual enough, so that the\\ndisplaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle to the ship’s\\nmovements.\\n\\n“These two dimensions allow you to obtain, via a simple calculation,\\nthe surface area and volume of the Nautilus. Its surface area totals\\n1,011.45 square meters, its volume 1,507.2 cubic meters—which is\\ntantamount to saying that when it’s completely submerged, it displaces\\n1,500 cubic meters of water, or weighs 1,500 metric tons.\\n\\n“In drawing up plans for a ship meant to navigate underwater, I wanted\\nit, when floating on the waves, to lie nine-tenths below the surface\\nand to emerge only one-tenth. Consequently, under these conditions it\\nneeded to displace only nine-tenths of its volume, hence 1,356.48\\ncubic meters; in other words, it was to weigh only that same number of\\nmetric tons. So I was obliged not to exceed this weight while building\\nit to the aforesaid dimensions.\\n\\n“The Nautilus is made up of two hulls, one inside the other; between\\nthem, joining them together, are iron T-bars that give this ship the\\nutmost rigidity. In fact, thanks to this cellular arrangement, it has\\nthe resistance of a stone block, as if it were completely solid. Its\\nplating can’t give way; it’s self-adhering and not dependent on the\\ntightness of its rivets; and due to the perfect union of its\\nmaterials, the solidarity of its construction allows it to defy the\\nmost violent seas.\\n\\n“The two hulls are manufactured from boilerplate steel, whose relative\\ndensity is 7.8 times that of water. The first hull has a thickness of\\nno less than five centimeters and weighs 394.96 metric tons. My second\\nhull, the outer cover, includes a keel fifty centimeters high by\\ntwenty-five wide, which by itself weighs 62 metric tons; this hull,\\nthe engine, the ballast, the various accessories and accommodations,\\nplus the bulkheads and interior braces, have a combined weight of\\n961.52 metric tons, which when added to 394.96 metric tons, gives us\\nthe desired total of 1,356.48 metric tons. Clear?”\\n\\n“Clear,” I replied.\\n\\n“So,” the captain went on, “when the Nautilus lies on the waves under\\nthese conditions, one-tenth of it does emerge above water. Now then,\\nif I provide some ballast tanks equal in capacity to that one-tenth,\\nhence able to hold 150.72 metric tons, and if I fill them with water,\\nthe boat then displaces 1,507.2 metric tons—or it weighs that much—and\\nit would be completely submerged. That’s what comes about,\\nprofessor. These ballast tanks exist within easy access in the lower\\nreaches of the Nautilus. I open some stopcocks, the tanks fill, the\\nboat sinks, and it’s exactly flush with the surface of the water.”\\n\\n“Fine, captain, but now we come to a genuine difficulty. You’re able\\nto lie flush with the surface of the ocean, that I understand. But\\nlower down, while diving beneath that surface, isn’t your submersible\\ngoing to encounter a pressure, and consequently undergo an upward\\nthrust, that must be assessed at one atmosphere per every thirty feet\\nof water, hence at about one kilogram per each square centimeter?”\\n\\n“Precisely, sir.”\\n\\n“Then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus, I don’t see how you can\\nforce it down into the heart of these liquid masses.”\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo replied, “static objects mustn’t be confused\\nwith dynamic ones, or we’ll be open to serious error. Comparatively\\nlittle effort is spent in reaching the ocean’s lower regions, because\\nall objects have a tendency to become ‘sinkers.’ Follow my logic\\nhere.”\\n\\n“I’m all ears, captain.”\\n\\n“When I wanted to determine what increase in weight the Nautilus\\nneeded to be given in order to submerge, I had only to take note of\\nthe proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences in\\ndeeper and deeper strata.”\\n\\n“That’s obvious,” I replied.\\n\\n“Now then, if water isn’t absolutely incompressible, at least it\\ncompresses very little. In fact, according to the most recent\\ncalculations, this reduction is only .0000436 per atmosphere, or per\\nevery thirty feet of depth. For instance, to go 1,000 meters down, I\\nmust take into account the reduction in volume that occurs under a\\npressure equivalent to that from a 1,000-meter column of water, in\\nother words, under a pressure of 100 atmospheres. In this instance the\\nreduction would be .00436. Consequently, I’d have to increase my\\nweight from 1,507.2 metric tons to 1,513.77. So the added weight would\\nonly be 6.57 metric tons.”\\n\\n“That’s all?”\\n\\n“That’s all, Professor Aronnax, and the calculation is easy to\\ncheck. Now then, I have supplementary ballast tanks capable of\\nshipping 100 metric tons of water. So I can descend to considerable\\ndepths. When I want to rise again and lie flush with the surface, all\\nI have to do is expel that water; and if I desire that the Nautilus\\nemerge above the waves to one-tenth of its total capacity, I empty all\\nthe ballast tanks completely.”\\n\\nThis logic, backed up by figures, left me without a single objection.\\n\\n“I accept your calculations, captain,” I replied, “and I’d be\\nill-mannered to dispute them, since your daily experience bears them\\nout. But at this juncture, I have a hunch that we’re still left with\\none real difficulty.”\\n\\n“What’s that, sir?”\\n\\n“When you’re at a depth of 1,000 meters, the Nautilus’s plating bears\\na pressure of 100 atmospheres. If at this point you want to empty the\\nsupplementary ballast tanks in order to lighten your boat and rise to\\nthe surface, your pumps must overcome that pressure of 100\\natmospheres, which is 100 kilograms per each square centimeter. This\\ndemands a strength—”\\n\\n“That electricity alone can give me,” Captain Nemo said swiftly. “Sir,\\nI repeat: the dynamic power of my engines is nearly infinite. The\\nNautilus’s pumps have prodigious strength, as you must have noticed\\nwhen their waterspouts swept like a torrent over the Abraham\\nLincoln. Besides, I use my supplementary ballast tanks only to reach\\nan average depth of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, and that with a view to\\nconserving my machinery. Accordingly, when I have a mind to visit the\\nocean depths two or three vertical leagues beneath the surface, I use\\nmaneuvers that are more time-consuming but no less infallible.”\\n\\n“What are they, captain?” I asked.\\n\\n“Here I’m naturally led into telling you how the Nautilus is\\nmaneuvered.”\\n\\n“I can’t wait to find out.”\\n\\n“In order to steer this boat to port or starboard, in short, to make\\nturns on a horizontal plane, I use an ordinary, wide-bladed rudder\\nthat’s fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel and\\ntackle. But I can also move the Nautilus upward and downward on a\\nvertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins, which\\nare attached to its sides at its center of flotation; these fins are\\nflexible, able to assume any position, and can be operated from inside\\nby means of powerful levers. If these fins stay parallel with the\\nboat, the latter moves horizontally. If they slant, the Nautilus\\nfollows the angle of that slant and, under its propeller’s thrust,\\neither sinks on a diagonal as steep as it suits me, or rises on that\\ndiagonal. And similarly, if I want to return more swiftly to the\\nsurface, I throw the propeller in gear, and the water’s pressure makes\\nthe Nautilus rise vertically, as an air balloon inflated with hydrogen\\nlifts swiftly into the skies.”\\n\\n“Bravo, captain!” I exclaimed. “But in the midst of the waters, how\\ncan your helmsman follow the course you’ve given him?”\\n\\n“My helmsman is stationed behind the windows of a pilothouse, which\\nprotrudes from the topside of the Nautilus’s hull and is fitted with\\nbiconvex glass.”\\n\\n“Is glass capable of resisting such pressures?”\\n\\n“Perfectly capable. Though fragile on impact, crystal can still offer\\nconsiderable resistance. In 1864, during experiments on fishing by\\nelectric light in the middle of the North Sea, glass panes less than\\nseven millimeters thick were seen to resist a pressure of sixteen\\natmospheres, all the while letting through strong, heat-generating\\nrays whose warmth was unevenly distributed. Now then, I use glass\\nwindows measuring no less than twenty-one centimeters at their\\ncenters; in other words, they’ve thirty times the thickness.”\\n\\n“Fair enough, captain, but if we’re going to see, we need light to\\ndrive away the dark, and in the midst of the murky waters, I wonder\\nhow your helmsman can—”\\n\\n“Set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector whose\\nrays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile.”\\n\\n“Oh, bravo! Bravo three times over, captain! That explains the\\nphosphorescent glow from this so-called narwhale that so puzzled us\\nscientists! Pertinent to this, I’ll ask you if the Nautilus’s running\\nafoul of the Scotia, which caused such a great uproar, was the result\\nof an accidental encounter?”\\n\\n“Entirely accidental, sir. I was navigating two meters beneath the\\nsurface of the water when the collision occurred. However, I could see\\nthat it had no dire consequences.”\\n\\n“None, sir. But as for your encounter with the Abraham Lincoln\\n. . . ?”\\n\\n“Professor, that troubled me, because it’s one of the best ships in\\nthe gallant American navy, but they attacked me and I had to defend\\nmyself! All the same, I was content simply to put the frigate in a\\ncondition where it could do me no harm; it won’t have any difficulty\\ngetting repairs at the nearest port.”\\n\\n“Ah, commander,” I exclaimed with conviction, “your Nautilus is truly\\na marvelous boat!”\\n\\n“Yes, professor,” Captain Nemo replied with genuine excitement, “and I\\nlove it as if it were my own flesh and blood! Aboard a conventional\\nship, facing the ocean’s perils, danger lurks everywhere; on the\\nsurface of the sea, your chief sensation is the constant feeling of an\\nunderlying chasm, as the Dutchman Jansen so aptly put it; but below\\nthe waves aboard the Nautilus, your heart never fails you! There are\\nno structural deformities to worry about, because the double hull of\\nthis boat has the rigidity of iron; no rigging to be worn out by\\nrolling and pitching on the waves; no sails for the wind to carry off;\\nno boilers for steam to burst open; no fires to fear, because this\\nsubmersible is made of sheet iron not wood; no coal to run out of,\\nsince electricity is its mechanical force; no collisions to fear,\\nbecause it navigates the watery deep all by itself; no storms to\\nbrave, because just a few meters beneath the waves, it finds absolute\\ntranquility! There, sir. There’s the ideal ship! And if it’s true that\\nthe engineer has more confidence in a craft than the builder, and the\\nbuilder more than the captain himself, you can understand the utter\\nabandon with which I place my trust in this Nautilus, since I’m its\\ncaptain, builder, and engineer all in one!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo spoke with winning eloquence. The fire in his eyes and\\nthe passion in his gestures transfigured him. Yes, he loved his ship\\nthe same way a father loves his child!\\n\\nBut one question, perhaps indiscreet, naturally popped up, and I\\ncouldn’t resist asking it.\\n\\n“You’re an engineer, then, Captain Nemo?”\\n\\n“Yes, professor,” he answered me. “I studied in London, Paris, and New\\nYork back in the days when I was a resident of the earth’s\\ncontinents.”\\n\\n“But how were you able to build this wonderful Nautilus in secret?”\\n\\n“Each part of it, Professor Aronnax, came from a different spot on the\\nglobe and reached me at a cover address. Its keel was forged by\\nCreusot in France, its propeller shaft by Pen & Co. in London, the\\nsheet-iron plates for its hull by Laird’s in Liverpool, its propeller\\nby Scott’s in Glasgow. Its tanks were manufactured by Cail & Co. in\\nParis, its engine by Krupp in Prussia, its spur by the Motala\\nworkshops in Sweden, its precision instruments by Hart Bros. in New\\nYork, etc.; and each of these suppliers received my specifications\\nunder a different name.”\\n\\n“But,” I went on, “once these parts were manufactured, didn’t they\\nhave to be mounted and adjusted?”\\n\\n“Professor, I set up my workshops on a deserted islet in\\nmidocean. There our Nautilus was completed by me and my workmen, in\\nother words, by my gallant companions whom I’ve molded and\\neducated. Then, when the operation was over, we burned every trace of\\nour stay on that islet, which if I could have, I’d have blown up.”\\n\\n“From all this, may I assume that such a boat costs a fortune?”\\n\\n“An iron ship, Professor Aronnax, runs 1,125 francs per metric\\nton. Now then, the Nautilus has a burden of 1,500 metric\\ntons. Consequently, it cost 1,687,000 francs, hence 2,000,000 francs\\nincluding its accommodations, and 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 with all the\\ncollections and works of art it contains.”\\n\\n“One last question, Captain Nemo.”\\n\\n“Ask, professor.”\\n\\n“You’re rich, then?”\\n\\n“Infinitely rich, sir, and without any trouble, I could pay off the\\nten-billion-franc French national debt!”\\n\\nI gaped at the bizarre individual who had just spoken these words. Was\\nhe playing on my credulity? Time would tell.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nThe Black Current\\n\\n\\nTHE PART OF THE planet earth that the seas occupy has been assessed at\\n3,832,558 square myriameters, hence more than 38,000,000,000\\nhectares. This liquid mass totals 2,250,000,000 cubic miles and could\\nform a sphere with a diameter of sixty leagues, whose weight would be\\nthree quintillion metric tons. To appreciate such a number, we should\\nremember that a quintillion is to a billion what a billion is to one,\\nin other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion as ones in\\na billion! Now then, this liquid mass nearly equals the total amount\\nof water that has poured through all the earth’s rivers for the past\\n40,000 years!\\n\\nDuring prehistoric times, an era of fire was followed by an era of\\nwater. At first there was ocean everywhere. Then, during the Silurian\\nperiod, the tops of mountains gradually appeared above the waves,\\nislands emerged, disappeared beneath temporary floods, rose again,\\nwere fused to form continents, and finally the earth’s geography\\nsettled into what we have today. Solid matter had wrested from liquid\\nmatter some 37,657,000 square miles, hence 12,916,000,000 hectares.\\n\\nThe outlines of the continents allow the seas to be divided into five\\nmajor parts: the frozen Arctic and Antarctic oceans, the Indian Ocean,\\nthe Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nThe Pacific Ocean extends north to south between the two polar circles\\nand east to west between America and Asia over an expanse of 145\\ndegrees of longitude. It’s the most tranquil of the seas; its currents\\nare wide and slow-moving, its tides moderate, its rainfall\\nabundant. And this was the ocean that I was first destined to cross\\nunder these strangest of auspices.\\n\\n“If you don’t mind, professor,” Captain Nemo told me, “we’ll determine\\nour exact position and fix the starting point of our voyage. It’s\\nfifteen minutes before noon. I’m going to rise to the surface of the\\nwater.”\\n\\nThe captain pressed an electric bell three times. The pumps began to\\nexpel water from the ballast tanks; on the pressure gauge, a needle\\nmarked the decreasing pressures that indicated the Nautilus’s upward\\nprogress; then the needle stopped.\\n\\n“Here we are,” the captain said.\\n\\nI made my way to the central companionway, which led to the\\nplatform. I climbed its metal steps, passed through the open hatches,\\nand arrived topside on the Nautilus.\\n\\nThe platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves. The\\nNautilus’s bow and stern boasted that spindle-shaped outline that had\\ncaused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar. I noted\\nthe slight overlap of its sheet-iron plates, which resembled the\\nscales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles. So I had a\\nperfectly natural explanation for why, despite the best spyglasses,\\nthis boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal.\\n\\nNear the middle of the platform, the skiff was half set in the ship’s\\nhull, making a slight bulge. Fore and aft stood two cupolas of\\nmoderate height, their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy\\nbiconvex glass, one reserved for the helmsman steering the Nautilus,\\nthe other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon lighting\\nhis way.\\n\\nThe sea was magnificent, the skies clear. This long aquatic vehicle\\ncould barely feel the broad undulations of the ocean. A mild breeze\\nout of the east rippled the surface of the water. Free of all mist,\\nthe horizon was ideal for taking sights.\\n\\nThere was nothing to be seen. Not a reef, not an islet. No more\\nAbraham Lincoln. A deserted immenseness.\\n\\nRaising his sextant, Captain Nemo took the altitude of the sun, which\\nwould give him his latitude. He waited for a few minutes until the orb\\ntouched the rim of the horizon. While he was taking his sights, he\\ndidn’t move a muscle, and the instrument couldn’t have been steadier\\nin hands made out of marble.\\n\\n“Noon,” he said. “Professor, whenever you’re ready. . . .”\\n\\nI took one last look at the sea, a little yellowish near the landing\\nplaces of Japan, and I went below again to the main lounge.\\n\\nThere the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer to\\ncalculate his longitude, which he double-checked against his previous\\nobservations of hour angles. Then he told me:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax, we’re in longitude 137 degrees 15’ west—”\\n\\n“West of which meridian?” I asked quickly, hoping the captain’s reply\\nmight give me a clue to his nationality.\\n\\n“Sir,” he answered me, “I have chronometers variously set to the\\nmeridians of Paris, Greenwich, and Washington, D.C. But in your honor,\\nI’ll use the one for Paris.”\\n\\nThis reply told me nothing. I bowed, and the commander went on:\\n\\n“We’re in longitude 137 degrees 15’ west of the meridian of Paris, and\\nlatitude 30 degrees 7’ north, in other words, about 300 miles from the\\nshores of Japan. At noon on this day of November 8, we hereby begin\\nour voyage of exploration under the waters.”\\n\\n“May God be with us!” I replied.\\n\\n“And now, professor,” the captain added, “I’ll leave you to your\\nintellectual pursuits. I’ve set our course east-northeast at a depth\\nof fifty meters. Here are some large-scale charts on which you’ll be\\nable to follow that course. The lounge is at your disposal, and with\\nyour permission, I’ll take my leave.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo bowed. I was left to myself, lost in my thoughts. They\\nall centered on the Nautilus’s commander. Would I ever learn the\\nnationality of this eccentric man who had boasted of having none? His\\nsworn hate for humanity, a hate that perhaps was bent on some dreadful\\nrevenge—what had provoked it? Was he one of those unappreciated\\nscholars, one of those geniuses “embittered by the world,” as Conseil\\nexpressed it, a latter-day Galileo, or maybe one of those men of\\nscience, like America’s Commander Maury, whose careers were ruined by\\npolitical revolutions? I couldn’t say yet. As for me, whom fate had\\njust brought aboard his vessel, whose life he had held in the balance:\\nhe had received me coolly but hospitably. Only, he never took the hand\\nI extended to him. He never extended his own.\\n\\nFor an entire hour I was deep in these musings, trying to probe this\\nmystery that fascinated me so. Then my eyes focused on a huge world\\nmap displayed on the table, and I put my finger on the very spot where\\nour just-determined longitude and latitude intersected.\\n\\nLike the continents, the sea has its rivers. These are exclusive\\ncurrents that can be identified by their temperature and color, the\\nmost remarkable being the one called the Gulf Stream. Science has\\ndefined the global paths of five chief currents: one in the north\\nAtlantic, a second in the south Atlantic, a third in the north\\nPacific, a fourth in the south Pacific, and a fifth in the southern\\nIndian Ocean. Also it’s likely that a sixth current used to exist in\\nthe northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas joined up\\nwith certain large Asian lakes to form a single uniform expanse of\\nwater.\\n\\nNow then, at the spot indicated on the world map, one of these\\nseagoing rivers was rolling by, the Kuroshio of the Japanese, the\\nBlack Current: heated by perpendicular rays from the tropical sun, it\\nleaves the Bay of Bengal, crosses the Strait of Malacca, goes up the\\nshores of Asia, and curves into the north Pacific as far as the\\nAleutian Islands, carrying along trunks of camphor trees and other\\nlocal items, the pure indigo of its warm waters sharply contrasting\\nwith the ocean’s waves. It was this current the Nautilus was about to\\ncross. I watched it on the map with my eyes, I saw it lose itself in\\nthe immenseness of the Pacific, and I felt myself swept along with it,\\nwhen Ned Land and Conseil appeared in the lounge doorway.\\n\\nMy two gallant companions stood petrified at the sight of the wonders\\non display.\\n\\n“Where are we?” the Canadian exclaimed. “In the Quebec Museum?”\\n\\n“Begging master’s pardon,” Conseil answered, “but this seems more like\\nthe Sommerard artifacts exhibition!”\\n\\n“My friends,” I replied, signaling them to enter, “you’re in neither\\nCanada nor France, but securely aboard the Nautilus, fifty meters\\nbelow sea level.”\\n\\n“If master says so, then so be it,” Conseil answered. “But in all\\nhonesty, this lounge is enough to astonish even someone Flemish like\\nmyself.”\\n\\n“Indulge your astonishment, my friend, and have a look, because\\nthere’s plenty of work here for a classifier of your talents.”\\n\\nConseil needed no encouraging. Bending over the glass cases, the\\ngallant lad was already muttering choice words from the naturalist’s\\nvocabulary: class Gastropoda, family Buccinoidea, genus cowry, species\\nCypraea madagascariensis, etc.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ned Land, less dedicated to conchology, questioned me about\\nmy interview with Captain Nemo. Had I discovered who he was, where he\\ncame from, where he was heading, how deep he was taking us? In short,\\na thousand questions I had no time to answer.\\n\\nI told him everything I knew—or, rather, everything I didn’t know—and\\nI asked him what he had seen or heard on his part.\\n\\n“Haven’t seen or heard a thing!” the Canadian replied. “I haven’t even\\nspotted the crew of this boat. By any chance, could they be electric\\ntoo?”\\n\\n“Electric?”\\n\\n“Oh ye gods, I’m half tempted to believe it! But back to you,\\nProfessor Aronnax,” Ned Land said, still hanging on to his\\nideas. “Can’t you tell me how many men are on board? Ten, twenty,\\nfifty, a hundred?”\\n\\n“I’m unable to answer you, Mr. Land. And trust me on this: for the\\ntime being, get rid of these notions of taking over the Nautilus or\\nescaping from it. This boat is a masterpiece of modern technology, and\\nI’d be sorry to have missed it! Many people would welcome the\\ncircumstances that have been handed us, just to walk in the midst of\\nthese wonders. So keep calm, and let’s see what’s happening around\\nus.”\\n\\n“See!” the harpooner exclaimed. “There’s nothing to see, nothing we’ll\\never see from this sheet-iron prison! We’re simply running around\\nblindfolded—”\\n\\nNed Land was just pronouncing these last words when we were suddenly\\nplunged into darkness, utter darkness. The ceiling lights went out so\\nquickly, my eyes literally ached, just as if we had experienced the\\nopposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom to the brightest\\nsunlight.\\n\\nWe stood stock-still, not knowing what surprise was waiting for us,\\nwhether pleasant or unpleasant. But a sliding sound became\\naudible. You could tell that some panels were shifting over the\\nNautilus’s sides.\\n\\n“It’s the beginning of the end!” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“. . . order Hydromedusa,” Conseil muttered.\\n\\nSuddenly, through two oblong openings, daylight appeared on both sides\\nof the lounge. The liquid masses came into view, brightly lit by the\\nship’s electric outpourings. We were separated from the sea by two\\npanes of glass. Initially I shuddered at the thought that these\\nfragile partitions could break; but strong copper bands secured them,\\ngiving them nearly infinite resistance.\\n\\nThe sea was clearly visible for a one-mile radius around the\\nNautilus. What a sight! What pen could describe it? Who could portray\\nthe effects of this light through these translucent sheets of water,\\nthe subtlety of its progressive shadings into the ocean’s upper and\\nlower strata?\\n\\nThe transparency of salt water has long been recognized. Its clarity\\nis believed to exceed that of spring water. The mineral and organic\\nsubstances it holds in suspension actually increase its\\ntranslucency. In certain parts of the Caribbean Sea, you can see the\\nsandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep as 145 meters down,\\nand the penetrating power of the sun’s rays seems to give out only at\\na depth of 300 meters. But in this fluid setting traveled by the\\nNautilus, our electric glow was being generated in the very heart of\\nthe waves. It was no longer illuminated water, it was liquid light.\\n\\nIf we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist Ehrenberg—who\\nbelieves that these underwater depths are lit up by phosphorescent\\norganisms—nature has certainly saved one of her most prodigious sights\\nfor residents of the sea, and I could judge for myself from the\\nthousandfold play of the light. On both sides I had windows opening\\nover these unexplored depths. The darkness in the lounge enhanced the\\nbrightness outside, and we stared as if this clear glass were the\\nwindow of an immense aquarium.\\n\\nThe Nautilus seemed to be standing still. This was due to the lack of\\nlandmarks. But streaks of water, parted by the ship’s spur, sometimes\\nthreaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed.\\n\\nIn wonderment, we leaned on our elbows before these show windows, and\\nour stunned silence remained unbroken until Conseil said:\\n\\n“You wanted to see something, Ned my friend; well, now you have\\nsomething to see!”\\n\\n“How unusual!” the Canadian put in, setting aside his tantrums and\\ngetaway schemes while submitting to this irresistible allure. “A man\\nwould go an even greater distance just to stare at such a sight!”\\n\\n“Ah!” I exclaimed. “I see our captain’s way of life! He’s found\\nhimself a separate world that saves its most astonishing wonders just\\nfor him!”\\n\\n“But where are the fish?” the Canadian ventured to observe. “I don’t\\nsee any fish!”\\n\\n“Why would you care, Ned my friend?” Conseil replied. “Since you have\\nno knowledge of them.”\\n\\n“Me? A fisherman!” Ned Land exclaimed.\\n\\nAnd on this subject a dispute arose between the two friends, since\\nboth were knowledgeable about fish, but from totally different\\nstandpoints.\\n\\nEveryone knows that fish make up the fourth and last class in the\\nvertebrate branch. They have been quite aptly defined as:\\n“cold-blooded vertebrates with a double circulatory system, breathing\\nthrough gills, and designed to live in water.” They consist of two\\ndistinct series: the series of bony fish, in other words, those whose\\nspines have vertebrae made of bone; and cartilaginous fish, in other\\nwords, those whose spines have vertebrae made of cartilage.\\n\\nPossibly the Canadian was familiar with this distinction, but Conseil\\nknew far more about it; and since he and Ned were now fast friends, he\\njust had to show off. So he told the harpooner:\\n\\n“Ned my friend, you’re a slayer of fish, a highly skilled\\nfisherman. You’ve caught a large number of these fascinating\\nanimals. But I’ll bet you don’t know how they’re classified.”\\n\\n“Sure I do,” the harpooner replied in all seriousness. “They’re\\nclassified into fish we eat and fish we don’t eat!”\\n\\n“Spoken like a true glutton,” Conseil replied. “But tell me, are you\\nfamiliar with the differences between bony fish and cartilaginous\\nfish?”\\n\\n“Just maybe, Conseil.”\\n\\n“And how about the subdivisions of these two large classes?”\\n\\n“I haven’t the foggiest notion,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“All right, listen and learn, Ned my friend! Bony fish are subdivided\\ninto six orders. Primo, the acanthopterygians, whose upper jaw is\\nfully formed and free-moving, and whose gills take the shape of a\\ncomb. This order consists of fifteen families, in other words,\\nthree-quarters of all known fish. Example: the common perch.”\\n\\n“Pretty fair eating,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Secundo,” Conseil went on, “the abdominals, whose pelvic fins hang\\nunder the abdomen to the rear of the pectorals but aren’t attached to\\nthe shoulder bone, an order that’s divided into five families and\\nmakes up the great majority of freshwater fish. Examples: carp, pike.”\\n\\n“Ugh!” the Canadian put in with distinct scorn. “You can keep the\\nfreshwater fish!”\\n\\n“Tertio,” Conseil said, “the subbrachians, whose pelvic fins are\\nattached under the pectorals and hang directly from the shoulder\\nbone. This order contains four families. Examples: flatfish such as\\nsole, turbot, dab, plaice, brill, etc.”\\n\\n“Excellent, really excellent!” the harpooner exclaimed, interested in\\nfish only from an edible viewpoint.\\n\\n“Quarto,” Conseil went on, unabashed, “the apods, with long bodies\\nthat lack pelvic fins and are covered by a heavy, often glutinous\\nskin, an order consisting of only one family. Examples: common eels\\nand electric eels.”\\n\\n“So-so, just so-so!” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Quinto,” Conseil said, “the lophobranchians, which have fully formed,\\nfree-moving jaws but whose gills consist of little tufts arranged in\\npairs along their gill arches. This order includes only one\\nfamily. Examples: seahorses and dragonfish.”\\n\\n“Bad, very bad!” the harpooner replied.\\n\\n“Sexto and last,” Conseil said, “the plectognaths, whose maxillary\\nbone is firmly attached to the side of the intermaxillary that forms\\nthe jaw, and whose palate arch is locked to the skull by sutures that\\nrender the jaw immovable, an order lacking true pelvic fins and which\\nconsists of two families. Examples: puffers and moonfish.”\\n\\n“They’re an insult to a frying pan!” the Canadian exclaimed.\\n\\n“Are you grasping all this, Ned my friend?” asked the scholarly\\nConseil.\\n\\n“Not a lick of it, Conseil my friend,” the harpooner replied. “But\\nkeep going, because you fill me with fascination.”\\n\\n“As for cartilaginous fish,” Conseil went on unflappably, “they\\nconsist of only three orders.”\\n\\n“Good news,” Ned put in.\\n\\n“Primo, the cyclostomes, whose jaws are fused into a flexible ring and\\nwhose gill openings are simply a large number of holes, an order\\nconsisting of only one family. Example: the lamprey.”\\n\\n“An acquired taste,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Secundo, the selacians, with gills resembling those of the\\ncyclostomes but whose lower jaw is free-moving. This order, which is\\nthe most important in the class, consists of two families. Examples:\\nthe ray and the shark.”\\n\\n“What!” Ned Land exclaimed. “Rays and man-eaters in the same order?\\nWell, Conseil my friend, on behalf of the rays, I wouldn’t advise you\\nto put them in the same fish tank!”\\n\\n“Tertio,” Conseil replied, “The sturionians, whose gill opening is the\\nusual single slit adorned with a gill cover, an order consisting of\\nfour genera. Example: the sturgeon.”\\n\\n“Ah, Conseil my friend, you saved the best for last, in my opinion\\nanyhow! And that’s all of ‘em?”\\n\\n“Yes, my gallant Ned,” Conseil replied. “And note well, even when one\\nhas grasped all this, one still knows next to nothing, because these\\nfamilies are subdivided into genera, subgenera, species, varieties—”\\n\\n“All right, Conseil my friend,” the harpooner said, leaning toward the\\nglass panel, “here come a couple of your varieties now!”\\n\\n“Yes! Fish!” Conseil exclaimed. “One would think he was in front of an\\naquarium!”\\n\\n“No,” I replied, “because an aquarium is nothing more than a cage, and\\nthese fish are as free as birds in the air!”\\n\\n“Well, Conseil my friend, identify them! Start naming them!” Ned Land\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n“Me?” Conseil replied. “I’m unable to! That’s my employer’s\\nbailiwick!”\\n\\nAnd in truth, although the fine lad was a classifying maniac, he was\\nno naturalist, and I doubt that he could tell a bonito from a tuna. In\\nshort, he was the exact opposite of the Canadian, who knew nothing\\nabout classification but could instantly put a name to any fish.\\n\\n“A triggerfish,” I said.\\n\\n“It’s a Chinese triggerfish,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\n“Genus Balistes, family Scleroderma, order Plectognatha,” Conseil\\nmuttered.\\n\\nAssuredly, Ned and Conseil in combination added up to one outstanding\\nnaturalist.\\n\\nThe Canadian was not mistaken. Cavorting around the Nautilus was a\\nschool of triggerfish with flat bodies, grainy skins, armed with\\nstings on their dorsal fins, and with four prickly rows of quills\\nquivering on both sides of their tails. Nothing could have been more\\nwonderful than the skin covering them: white underneath, gray above,\\nwith spots of gold sparkling in the dark eddies of the waves. Around\\nthem, rays were undulating like sheets flapping in the wind, and among\\nthese I spotted, much to my glee, a Chinese ray, yellowish on its\\ntopside, a dainty pink on its belly, and armed with three stings\\nbehind its eyes; a rare species whose very existence was still doubted\\nin Lacépède’s day, since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen\\none only in a portfolio of Japanese drawings.\\n\\nFor two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the Nautilus. In the midst\\nof their leaping and cavorting, while they competed with each other in\\nbeauty, radiance, and speed, I could distinguish some green wrasse,\\nbewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines, white gobies from\\nthe genus Eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the\\nback, wonderful Japanese mackerel from the genus Scomber with blue\\nbodies and silver heads, glittering azure goldfish whose name by\\nitself gives their full description, several varieties of porgy or\\ngilthead (some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow,\\nsome with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip\\naround their caudal area, some with color zones and elegantly corseted\\nin their six waistbands), trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked\\nlike genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long,\\nJapanese salamanders, serpentine moray eels from the genus Echidna\\nthat were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth\\nbristling with teeth; etc.\\n\\nOur wonderment stayed at an all-time fever pitch. Our exclamations\\nwere endless. Ned identified the fish, Conseil classified them, and as\\nfor me, I was in ecstasy over the verve of their movements and the\\nbeauty of their forms. Never before had I been given the chance to\\nglimpse these animals alive and at large in their native element.\\n\\nGiven such a complete collection from the seas of Japan and China, I\\nwon’t mention every variety that passed before our dazzled eyes. More\\nnumerous than birds in the air, these fish raced right up to us, no\\ndoubt attracted by the brilliant glow of our electric beacon.\\n\\nSuddenly daylight appeared in the lounge. The sheet-iron panels slid\\nshut. The magical vision disappeared. But for a good while I kept\\ndreaming away, until the moment my eyes focused on the instruments\\nhanging on the wall. The compass still showed our heading as\\neast-northeast, the pressure gauge indicated a pressure of five\\natmospheres (corresponding to a depth of fifty meters), and the\\nelectric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour.\\n\\nI waited for Captain Nemo. But he didn’t appear. The clock marked the\\nhour of five.\\n\\nNed Land and Conseil returned to their cabin. As for me, I repaired to\\nmy stateroom. There I found dinner ready for me. It consisted of\\nturtle soup made from the daintiest hawksbill, a red mullet with\\nwhite, slightly flaky flesh, whose liver, when separately prepared,\\nmakes delicious eating, plus loin of imperial angelfish, whose flavor\\nstruck me as even better than salmon.\\n\\nI spent the evening in reading, writing, and thinking. Then drowsiness\\novertook me, I stretched out on my eelgrass mattress, and I fell into\\na deep slumber, while the Nautilus glided through the swiftly flowing\\nBlack Current.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nAn Invitation in Writing\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY, November 9, I woke up only after a long, twelve-hour\\nslumber. Conseil, a creature of habit, came to ask “how master’s night\\nwent,” and to offer his services. He had left his Canadian friend\\nsleeping like a man who had never done anything else.\\n\\nI let the gallant lad babble as he pleased, without giving him much in\\nthe way of a reply. I was concerned about Captain Nemo’s absence\\nduring our session the previous afternoon, and I hoped to see him\\nagain today.\\n\\nSoon I had put on my clothes, which were woven from strands of\\nseashell tissue. More than once their composition provoked comments\\nfrom Conseil. I informed him that they were made from the smooth,\\nsilken filaments with which the fan mussel, a type of seashell quite\\nabundant along Mediterranean beaches, attaches itself to rocks. In\\nolden times, fine fabrics, stockings, and gloves were made from such\\nfilaments, because they were both very soft and very warm. So the\\nNautilus’s crew could dress themselves at little cost, without needing\\na thing from cotton growers, sheep, or silkworms on shore.\\n\\nAs soon as I was dressed, I made my way to the main lounge. It was\\ndeserted.\\n\\nI dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside the\\nglass cases. I also investigated the huge plant albums that were\\nfilled with the rarest marine herbs, which, although they were pressed\\nand dried, still kept their wonderful colors. Among these valuable\\nwater plants, I noted various seaweed: some Cladostephus\\nverticillatus, peacock’s tails, fig-leafed caulerpa, grain-bearing\\nbeauty bushes, delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet, sea colander\\narranged into fan shapes, mermaid’s cups that looked like the caps of\\nsquat mushrooms and for years had been classified among the zoophytes;\\nin short, a complete series of algae.\\n\\nThe entire day passed without my being honored by a visit from Captain\\nNemo. The panels in the lounge didn’t open. Perhaps they didn’t want\\nus to get tired of these beautiful things.\\n\\nThe Nautilus kept to an east-northeasterly heading, a speed of twelve\\nmiles per hour, and a depth between fifty and sixty meters.\\n\\nNext day, November 10: the same neglect, the same solitude. I didn’t\\nsee a soul from the crew. Ned and Conseil spent the better part of the\\nday with me. They were astonished at the captain’s inexplicable\\nabsence. Was this eccentric man ill? Did he want to change his plans\\nconcerning us?\\n\\nBut after all, as Conseil noted, we enjoyed complete freedom, we were\\ndaintily and abundantly fed. Our host had kept to the terms of his\\nagreement. We couldn’t complain, and moreover the very uniqueness of\\nour situation had such generous rewards in store for us, we had no\\ngrounds for criticism.\\n\\nThat day I started my diary of these adventures, which has enabled me\\nto narrate them with the most scrupulous accuracy; and one odd detail:\\nI wrote it on paper manufactured from marine eelgrass.\\n\\nEarly in the morning on November 11, fresh air poured through the\\nNautilus’s interior, informing me that we had returned to the surface\\nof the ocean to renew our oxygen supply. I headed for the central\\ncompanionway and climbed onto the platform.\\n\\nIt was six o’clock. I found the weather overcast, the sea gray but\\ncalm. Hardly a billow. I hoped to encounter Captain Nemo there—would\\nhe come? I saw only the helmsman imprisoned in his glass-windowed\\npilothouse. Seated on the ledge furnished by the hull of the skiff, I\\ninhaled the sea’s salty aroma with great pleasure.\\n\\nLittle by little, the mists were dispersed under the action of the\\nsun’s rays. The radiant orb cleared the eastern horizon. Under its\\ngaze, the sea caught on fire like a trail of gunpowder. Scattered on\\nhigh, the clouds were colored in bright, wonderfully shaded hues, and\\nnumerous “ladyfingers” warned of daylong winds.*\\n\\n*Author’s Note: “Ladyfingers” are small, thin, white clouds with\\n ragged edges.\\n\\nBut what were mere winds to this Nautilus, which no storms could\\nintimidate!\\n\\nSo I was marveling at this delightful sunrise, so life-giving and\\ncheerful, when I heard someone climbing onto the platform.\\n\\nI was prepared to greet Captain Nemo, but it was his chief officer who\\nappeared—whom I had already met during our first visit with the\\ncaptain. He advanced over the platform, not seeming to notice my\\npresence. A powerful spyglass to his eye, he scrutinized every point\\nof the horizon with the utmost care. Then, his examination over, he\\napproached the hatch and pronounced a phrase whose exact wording\\nfollows below. I remember it because, every morning, it was repeated\\nunder the same circumstances. It ran like this:\\n\\n“Nautron respoc lorni virch.”\\n\\nWhat it meant I was unable to say.\\n\\nThese words pronounced, the chief officer went below again. I thought\\nthe Nautilus was about to resume its underwater navigating. So I went\\ndown the hatch and back through the gangways to my stateroom.\\n\\nFive days passed in this way with no change in our situation. Every\\nmorning I climbed onto the platform. The same phrase was pronounced by\\nthe same individual. Captain Nemo did not appear.\\n\\nI was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him, when on\\nNovember 16, while reentering my stateroom with Ned and Conseil, I\\nfound a note addressed to me on the table.\\n\\nI opened it impatiently. It was written in a script that was clear and\\nneat but a bit “Old English” in style, its characters reminding me of\\nGerman calligraphy.\\n\\nThe note was worded as follows:\\n\\n  Professor Aronnax\\n  Aboard the Nautilus\\n  November 16, 1867\\n\\n  Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax on a hunting trip that will\\n  take place tomorrow morning in his Crespo Island forests. He hopes\\n  nothing will prevent the professor from attending, and he looks\\n  forward with pleasure to the professor’s companions joining him.\\n\\n  CAPTAIN NEMO,\\n  Commander of the Nautilus.\\n\\n“A hunting trip!” Ned exclaimed.\\n\\n“And in his forests on Crespo Island!” Conseil added.\\n\\n“But does this mean the old boy goes ashore?” Ned Land went on.\\n\\n“That seems to be the gist of it,” I said, rereading the letter.\\n\\n“Well, we’ve got to accept!” the Canadian answered. “Once we’re on\\nsolid ground, we’ll figure out a course of action. Besides, it\\nwouldn’t pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison!”\\n\\nWithout trying to reconcile the contradictions between Captain Nemo’s\\nprofessed horror of continents or islands and his invitation to go\\nhunting in a forest, I was content to reply:\\n\\n“First let’s look into this Crespo Island.”\\n\\nI consulted the world map; and in latitude 32 degrees 40’ north and\\nlongitude 167 degrees 50’ west, I found an islet that had been\\ndiscovered in 1801 by Captain Crespo, which old Spanish charts called\\nRocca de la Plata, in other words, “Silver Rock.” So we were about\\n1,800 miles from our starting point, and by a slight change of\\nheading, the Nautilus was bringing us back toward the southeast.\\n\\nI showed my companions this small, stray rock in the middle of the\\nnorth Pacific.\\n\\n“If Captain Nemo does sometimes go ashore,” I told them, “at least he\\nonly picks desert islands!”\\n\\nNed Land shook his head without replying; then he and Conseil left\\nme. After supper was served me by the mute and emotionless steward, I\\nfell asleep; but not without some anxieties.\\n\\nWhen I woke up the next day, November 17, I sensed that the Nautilus\\nwas completely motionless. I dressed hurriedly and entered the main\\nlounge.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was there waiting for me. He stood up, bowed, and asked\\nif it suited me to come along.\\n\\nSince he made no allusion to his absence the past eight days, I also\\nrefrained from mentioning it, and I simply answered that my companions\\nand I were ready to go with him.\\n\\n“Only, sir,” I added, “I’ll take the liberty of addressing a question\\nto you.”\\n\\n“Address away, Professor Aronnax, and if I’m able to answer, I will.”\\n\\n“Well then, captain, how is it that you’ve severed all ties with the\\nshore, yet you own forests on Crespo Island?”\\n\\n“Professor,” the captain answered me, “these forests of mine don’t\\nbask in the heat and light of the sun. They aren’t frequented by\\nlions, tigers, panthers, or other quadrupeds. They’re known only to\\nme. They grow only for me. These forests aren’t on land, they’re\\nactual underwater forests.”\\n\\n“Underwater forests!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, professor.”\\n\\n“And you’re offering to take me to them?”\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“On foot?”\\n\\n“Without getting your feet wet.”\\n\\n“While hunting?”\\n\\n“While hunting.”\\n\\n“Rifles in hand?”\\n\\n“Rifles in hand.”\\n\\nI stared at the Nautilus’s commander with an air anything but\\nflattering to the man.\\n\\n“Assuredly,” I said to myself, “he’s contracted some mental\\nillness. He’s had a fit that’s lasted eight days and isn’t over even\\nyet. What a shame! I liked him better eccentric than insane!”\\n\\nThese thoughts were clearly readable on my face; but Captain Nemo\\nremained content with inviting me to follow him, and I did so like a\\nman resigned to the worst.\\n\\nWe arrived at the dining room, where we found breakfast served.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” the captain told me, “I beg you to share my\\nbreakfast without formality. We can chat while we eat. Because,\\nalthough I promised you a stroll in my forests, I made no pledge to\\narrange for your encountering a restaurant there. Accordingly, eat\\nyour breakfast like a man who’ll probably eat dinner only when it’s\\nextremely late.”\\n\\nI did justice to this meal. It was made up of various fish and some\\nslices of sea cucumber, that praiseworthy zoophyte, all garnished with\\nsuch highly appetizing seaweed as the Porphyra laciniata and the\\nLaurencia primafetida. Our beverage consisted of clear water to which,\\nfollowing the captain’s example, I added some drops of a fermented\\nliquor extracted by the Kamchatka process from the seaweed known by\\nname as Rhodymenia palmata.\\n\\nAt first Captain Nemo ate without pronouncing a single word. Then he\\ntold me:\\n\\n“Professor, when I proposed that you go hunting in my Crespo forests,\\nyou thought I was contradicting myself. When I informed you that it\\nwas an issue of underwater forests, you thought I’d gone\\ninsane. Professor, you must never make snap judgments about your\\nfellow man.”\\n\\n“But, captain, believe me—”\\n\\n“Kindly listen to me, and you’ll see if you have grounds for accusing\\nme of insanity or self-contradiction.”\\n\\n“I’m all attention.”\\n\\n“Professor, you know as well as I do that a man can live underwater so\\nlong as he carries with him his own supply of breathable air. For\\nunderwater work projects, the workman wears a waterproof suit with his\\nhead imprisoned in a metal capsule, while he receives air from above\\nby means of force pumps and flow regulators.”\\n\\n“That’s the standard equipment for a diving suit,” I said.\\n\\n“Correct, but under such conditions the man has no freedom. He’s\\nattached to a pump that sends him air through an india-rubber hose;\\nit’s an actual chain that fetters him to the shore, and if we were to\\nbe bound in this way to the Nautilus, we couldn’t go far either.”\\n\\n“Then how do you break free?” I asked.\\n\\n“We use the Rouquayrol-Denayrouze device, invented by two of your\\nfellow countrymen but refined by me for my own special uses, thereby\\nenabling you to risk these new physiological conditions without\\nsuffering any organic disorders. It consists of a tank built from\\nheavy sheet iron in which I store air under a pressure of fifty\\natmospheres. This tank is fastened to the back by means of straps,\\nlike a soldier’s knapsack. Its top part forms a box where the air is\\nregulated by a bellows mechanism and can be released only at its\\nproper tension. In the Rouquayrol device that has been in general use,\\ntwo india-rubber hoses leave this box and feed to a kind of tent that\\nimprisons the operator’s nose and mouth; one hose is for the entrance\\nof air to be inhaled, the other for the exit of air to be exhaled, and\\nthe tongue closes off the former or the latter depending on the\\nbreather’s needs. But in my case, since I face considerable pressures\\nat the bottom of the sea, I needed to enclose my head in a copper\\nsphere, like those found on standard diving suits, and the two hoses\\nfor inhalation and exhalation now feed to that sphere.”\\n\\n“That’s perfect, Captain Nemo, but the air you carry must be quickly\\ndepleted; and once it contains no more than 15% oxygen, it becomes\\nunfit for breathing.”\\n\\n“Surely, but as I told you, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus’s pumps\\nenable me to store air under considerable pressure, and given this\\ncircumstance, the tank on my diving equipment can supply breathable\\nair for nine or ten hours.”\\n\\n“I’ve no more objections to raise,” I replied. “I’ll only ask you,\\ncaptain: how can you light your way at the bottom of the ocean?”\\n\\n“With the Ruhmkorff device, Professor Aronnax. If the first is carried\\non the back, the second is fastened to the belt. It consists of a\\nBunsen battery that I activate not with potassium dichromate but with\\nsodium. An induction coil gathers the electricity generated and\\ndirects it to a specially designed lantern. In this lantern one finds\\na glass spiral that contains only a residue of carbon dioxide\\ngas. When the device is operating, this gas becomes luminous and gives\\noff a continuous whitish light. Thus provided for, I breathe and I\\nsee.”\\n\\n“Captain Nemo, to my every objection you give such crushing answers,\\nI’m afraid to entertain a single doubt. However, though I have no\\nchoice but to accept both the Rouquayrol and Ruhmkorff devices, I’d\\nlike to register some reservations about the rifle with which you’ll\\nequip me.”\\n\\n“But it isn’t a rifle that uses gunpowder,” the captain replied.\\n\\n“Then it’s an air gun?”\\n\\n“Surely. How can I make gunpowder on my ship when I have no saltpeter,\\nsulfur, or charcoal?”\\n\\n“Even so,” I replied, “to fire underwater in a medium that’s 855 times\\ndenser than air, you’d have to overcome considerable resistance.”\\n\\n“That doesn’t necessarily follow. There are certain Fulton-style guns\\nperfected by the Englishmen Philippe-Coles and Burley, the Frenchman\\nFurcy, and the Italian Landi; they’re equipped with a special system\\nof airtight fastenings and can fire in underwater conditions. But I\\nrepeat: having no gunpowder, I’ve replaced it with air at high\\npressure, which is abundantly supplied me by the Nautilus’s pumps.”\\n\\n“But this air must be swiftly depleted.”\\n\\n“Well, in a pinch can’t my Rouquayrol tank supply me with more? All I\\nhave to do is draw it from an ad hoc spigot.* Besides, Professor\\nAronnax, you’ll see for yourself that during these underwater hunting\\ntrips, we make no great expenditure of either air or bullets.”\\n\\n*Latin: a spigot “just for that purpose.” Ed.\\n\\n“But it seems to me that in this semidarkness, amid this liquid that’s\\nso dense in comparison to the atmosphere, a gunshot couldn’t carry far\\nand would prove fatal only with difficulty!”\\n\\n“On the contrary, sir, with this rifle every shot is fatal; and as\\nsoon as the animal is hit, no matter how lightly, it falls as if\\nstruck by lightning.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Because this rifle doesn’t shoot ordinary bullets but little glass\\ncapsules invented by the Austrian chemist Leniebroek, and I have a\\nconsiderable supply of them. These glass capsules are covered with a\\nstrip of steel and weighted with a lead base; they’re genuine little\\nLeyden jars charged with high-voltage electricity. They go off at the\\nslightest impact, and the animal, no matter how strong, drops dead. I\\nmight add that these capsules are no bigger than number 4 shot, and\\nthe chamber of any ordinary rifle could hold ten of them.”\\n\\n“I’ll quit debating,” I replied, getting up from the table. “And all\\nthat’s left is for me to shoulder my rifle. So where you go, I’ll go.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo led me to the Nautilus’s stern, and passing by Ned and\\nConseil’s cabin, I summoned my two companions, who instantly followed\\nus.\\n\\nThen we arrived at a cell located within easy access of the engine\\nroom; in this cell we were to get dressed for our stroll.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\nStrolling the Plains\\n\\n\\nTHIS CELL, properly speaking, was the Nautilus’s arsenal and\\nwardrobe. Hanging from its walls, a dozen diving outfits were waiting\\nfor anybody who wanted to take a stroll.\\n\\nAfter seeing these, Ned Land exhibited an obvious distaste for the\\nidea of putting one on.\\n\\n“But my gallant Ned,” I told him, “the forests of Crespo Island are\\nsimply underwater forests!”\\n\\n“Oh great!” put in the disappointed harpooner, watching his dreams of\\nfresh meat fade away. “And you, Professor Aronnax, are you going to\\nstick yourself inside these clothes?”\\n\\n“It has to be, Mr. Ned.”\\n\\n“Have it your way, sir,” the harpooner replied, shrugging his\\nshoulders. “But speaking for myself, I’ll never get into those things\\nunless they force me!”\\n\\n“No one will force you, Mr. Land,” Captain Nemo said.\\n\\n“And is Conseil going to risk it?” Ned asked.\\n\\n“Where master goes, I go,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAt the captain’s summons, two crewmen came to help us put on these\\nheavy, waterproof clothes, made from seamless India rubber and\\nexpressly designed to bear considerable pressures. They were like\\nsuits of armor that were both yielding and resistant, you might\\nsay. These clothes consisted of jacket and pants. The pants ended in\\nbulky footwear adorned with heavy lead soles. The fabric of the jacket\\nwas reinforced with copper mail that shielded the chest, protected it\\nfrom the water’s pressure, and allowed the lungs to function freely;\\nthe sleeves ended in supple gloves that didn’t impede hand movements.\\n\\nThese perfected diving suits, it was easy to see, were a far cry from\\nsuch misshapen costumes as the cork breastplates, leather jumpers,\\nseagoing tunics, barrel helmets, etc., invented and acclaimed in the\\n18th century.\\n\\nConseil and I were soon dressed in these diving suits, as were Captain\\nNemo and one of his companions—a herculean type who must have been\\nprodigiously strong. All that remained was to encase one’s head in its\\nmetal sphere. But before proceeding with this operation, I asked the\\ncaptain for permission to examine the rifles set aside for us.\\n\\nOne of the Nautilus’s men presented me with a streamlined rifle whose\\nbutt was boilerplate steel, hollow inside, and of fairly large\\ndimensions. This served as a tank for the compressed air, which a\\ntrigger-operated valve could release into the metal chamber. In a\\ngroove where the butt was heaviest, a cartridge clip held some twenty\\nelectric bullets that, by means of a spring, automatically took their\\nplaces in the barrel of the rifle. As soon as one shot had been fired,\\nanother was ready to go off.\\n\\n“Captain Nemo,” I said, “this is an ideal, easy-to-use weapon. I ask\\nonly to put it to the test. But how will we reach the bottom of the\\nsea?”\\n\\n“Right now, professor, the Nautilus is aground in ten meters of water,\\nand we’ve only to depart.”\\n\\n“But how will we set out?”\\n\\n“You’ll see.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear. Conseil\\nand I did the same, but not without hearing the Canadian toss us a\\nsarcastic “happy hunting.” On top, the suit ended in a collar of\\nthreaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed. Three holes,\\nprotected by heavy glass, allowed us to see in any direction with\\nsimply a turn of the head inside the sphere. Placed on our backs, the\\nRouquayrol device went into operation as soon as it was in position,\\nand for my part, I could breathe with ease.\\n\\nThe Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, my rifle in hand, I was ready\\nto go forth. But in all honesty, while imprisoned in these heavy\\nclothes and nailed to the deck by my lead soles, it was impossible for\\nme to take a single step.\\n\\nBut this circumstance had been foreseen, because I felt myself\\npropelled into a little room adjoining the wardrobe. Towed in the same\\nway, my companions went with me. I heard a door with watertight seals\\nclose after us, and we were surrounded by profound darkness.\\n\\nAfter some minutes a sharp hissing reached my ears. I felt a distinct\\nsensation of cold rising from my feet to my chest. Apparently a\\nstopcock inside the boat was letting in water from outside, which\\noverran us and soon filled up the room. Contrived in the Nautilus’s\\nside, a second door then opened. We were lit by a subdued light. An\\ninstant later our feet were treading the bottom of the sea.\\n\\nAnd now, how can I convey the impressions left on me by this stroll\\nunder the waters. Words are powerless to describe such wonders! When\\neven the painter’s brush can’t depict the effects unique to the liquid\\nelement, how can the writer’s pen hope to reproduce them?\\n\\nCaptain Nemo walked in front, and his companion followed us a few\\nsteps to the rear. Conseil and I stayed next to each other, as if\\ndaydreaming that through our metal carapaces, a little polite\\nconversation might still be possible! Already I no longer felt the\\nbulkiness of my clothes, footwear, and air tank, nor the weight of the\\nheavy sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its\\nshell. Once immersed in water, all these objects lost a part of their\\nweight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced, and thanks to\\nthis law of physics discovered by Archimedes, I did just fine. I was\\nno longer an inert mass, and I had, comparatively speaking, great\\nfreedom of movement.\\n\\nLighting up the seafloor even thirty feet beneath the surface of the\\nocean, the sun astonished me with its power. The solar rays easily\\ncrossed this aqueous mass and dispersed its dark colors. I could\\neasily distinguish objects 100 meters away. Farther on, the bottom was\\ntinted with fine shades of ultramarine; then, off in the distance, it\\nturned blue and faded in the midst of a hazy darkness. Truly, this\\nwater surrounding me was just a kind of air, denser than the\\natmosphere on land but almost as transparent. Above me I could see the\\ncalm surface of the ocean.\\n\\nWe were walking on sand that was fine-grained and smooth, not wrinkled\\nlike beach sand, which preserves the impressions left by the\\nwaves. This dazzling carpet was a real mirror, throwing back the sun’s\\nrays with startling intensity. The outcome: an immense vista of\\nreflections that penetrated every liquid molecule. Will anyone believe\\nme if I assert that at this thirty-foot depth, I could see as if it\\nwas broad daylight?\\n\\nFor a quarter of an hour, I trod this blazing sand, which was strewn\\nwith tiny crumbs of seashell. Looming like a long reef, the Nautilus’s\\nhull disappeared little by little, but when night fell in the midst of\\nthe waters, the ship’s beacon would surely facilitate our return on\\nboard, since its rays carried with perfect distinctness. This effect\\nis difficult to understand for anyone who has never seen light beams\\nso sharply defined on shore. There the dust that saturates the air\\ngives such rays the appearance of a luminous fog; but above water as\\nwell as underwater, shafts of electric light are transmitted with\\nincomparable clarity.\\n\\nMeanwhile we went ever onward, and these vast plains of sand seemed\\nendless. My hands parted liquid curtains that closed again behind me,\\nand my footprints faded swiftly under the water’s pressure.\\n\\nSoon, scarcely blurred by their distance from us, the forms of some\\nobjects took shape before my eyes. I recognized the lower slopes of\\nsome magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zoophyte specimens, and\\nright off, I was struck by an effect unique to this medium.\\n\\nBy then it was ten o’clock in the morning. The sun’s rays hit the\\nsurface of the waves at a fairly oblique angle, decomposing by\\nrefraction as though passing through a prism; and when this light came\\nin contact with flowers, rocks, buds, seashells, and polyps, the edges\\nof these objects were shaded with all seven hues of the solar\\nspectrum. This riot of rainbow tints was a wonder, a feast for the\\neyes: a genuine kaleidoscope of red, green, yellow, orange, violet,\\nindigo, and blue; in short, the whole palette of a color-happy\\npainter! If only I had been able to share with Conseil the intense\\nsensations rising in my brain, competing with him in exclamations of\\nwonderment! If only I had known, like Captain Nemo and his companion,\\nhow to exchange thoughts by means of prearranged signals! So, for lack\\nof anything better, I talked to myself: I declaimed inside this copper\\nbox that topped my head, spending more air on empty words than was\\nperhaps advisable.\\n\\nConseil, like me, had stopped before this splendid sight. Obviously,\\nin the presence of these zoophyte and mollusk specimens, the fine lad\\nwas classifying his head off. Polyps and echinoderms abounded on the\\nseafloor: various isis coral, cornularian coral living in isolation,\\ntufts of virginal genus Oculina formerly known by the name “white\\ncoral,” prickly fungus coral in the shape of mushrooms, sea anemone\\nholding on by their muscular disks, providing a literal flowerbed\\nadorned by jellyfish from the genus Porpita wearing collars of azure\\ntentacles, and starfish that spangled the sand, including veinlike\\nfeather stars from the genus Asterophyton that were like fine lace\\nembroidered by the hands of water nymphs, their festoons swaying to\\nthe faint undulations caused by our walking. It filled me with real\\nchagrin to crush underfoot the gleaming mollusk samples that littered\\nthe seafloor by the thousands: concentric comb shells, hammer shells,\\ncoquina (seashells that actually hop around), top-shell snails, red\\nhelmet shells, angel-wing conchs, sea hares, and so many other\\nexhibits from this inexhaustible ocean. But we had to keep walking,\\nand we went forward while overhead there scudded schools of Portuguese\\nmen-of-war that let their ultramarine tentacles drift in their wakes,\\nmedusas whose milky white or dainty pink parasols were festooned with\\nazure tassels and shaded us from the sun’s rays, plus jellyfish of the\\nspecies Pelagia panopyra that, in the dark, would have strewn our path\\nwith phosphorescent glimmers!\\n\\nAll these wonders I glimpsed in the space of a quarter of a mile,\\nbarely pausing, following Captain Nemo whose gestures kept beckoning\\nme onward. Soon the nature of the seafloor changed. The plains of sand\\nwere followed by a bed of that viscous slime Americans call “ooze,”\\nwhich is composed exclusively of seashells rich in limestone or\\nsilica. Then we crossed a prairie of algae, open-sea plants that the\\nwaters hadn’t yet torn loose, whose vegetation grew in wild\\nprofusion. Soft to the foot, these densely textured lawns would have\\nrivaled the most luxuriant carpets woven by the hand of man. But while\\nthis greenery was sprawling under our steps, it didn’t neglect us\\noverhead. The surface of the water was crisscrossed by a floating\\narbor of marine plants belonging to that superabundant algae family\\nthat numbers more than 2,000 known species. I saw long ribbons of\\nfucus drifting above me, some globular, others tubular: Laurencia,\\nCladostephus with the slenderest foliage, Rhodymenia palmata\\nresembling the fan shapes of cactus. I observed that green-colored\\nplants kept closer to the surface of the sea, while reds occupied a\\nmedium depth, which left blacks and browns in charge of designing\\ngardens and flowerbeds in the ocean’s lower strata.\\n\\nThese algae are a genuine prodigy of creation, one of the wonders of\\nworld flora. This family produces both the biggest and smallest\\nvegetables in the world. Because, just as 40,000 near-invisible buds\\nhave been counted in one five-square-millimeter space, so also have\\nfucus plants been gathered that were over 500 meters long!\\n\\nWe had been gone from the Nautilus for about an hour and a half. It\\nwas almost noon. I spotted this fact in the perpendicularity of the\\nsun’s rays, which were no longer refracted. The magic of these solar\\ncolors disappeared little by little, with emerald and sapphire shades\\nvanishing from our surroundings altogether. We walked with steady\\nsteps that rang on the seafloor with astonishing intensity. The\\ntiniest sounds were transmitted with a speed to which the ear is\\nunaccustomed on shore. In fact, water is a better conductor of sound\\nthan air, and under the waves noises carry four times as fast.\\n\\nJust then the seafloor began to slope sharply downward. The light took\\non a uniform hue. We reached a depth of 100 meters, by which point we\\nwere undergoing a pressure of ten atmospheres. But my diving clothes\\nwere built along such lines that I never suffered from this\\npressure. I felt only a certain tightness in the joints of my fingers,\\nand even this discomfort soon disappeared. As for the exhaustion bound\\nto accompany a two-hour stroll in such unfamiliar trappings—it was\\nnil. Helped by the water, my movements were executed with startling\\nease.\\n\\nArriving at this 300-foot depth, I still detected the sun’s rays, but\\njust barely. Their intense brilliance had been followed by a reddish\\ntwilight, a midpoint between day and night. But we could see well\\nenough to find our way, and it still wasn’t necessary to activate the\\nRuhmkorff device.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo stopped. He waited until I joined him, then he\\npointed a finger at some dark masses outlined in the shadows a short\\ndistance away.\\n\\n“It’s the forest of Crespo Island,” I thought; and I was not mistaken.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\nAn Underwater Forest\\n\\n\\nWE HAD FINALLY arrived on the outskirts of this forest, surely one of\\nthe finest in Captain Nemo’s immense domains. He regarded it as his\\nown and had laid the same claim to it that, in the first days of the\\nworld, the first men had to their forests on land. Besides, who else\\ncould dispute his ownership of this underwater property? What other,\\nbolder pioneer would come, ax in hand, to clear away its dark\\nunderbrush?\\n\\nThis forest was made up of big treelike plants, and when we entered\\nbeneath their huge arches, my eyes were instantly struck by the unique\\narrangement of their branches—an arrangement that I had never before\\nencountered.\\n\\nNone of the weeds carpeting the seafloor, none of the branches\\nbristling from the shrubbery, crept, or leaned, or stretched on a\\nhorizontal plane. They all rose right up toward the surface of the\\nocean. Every filament or ribbon, no matter how thin, stood ramrod\\nstraight. Fucus plants and creepers were growing in stiff\\nperpendicular lines, governed by the density of the element that\\ngenerated them. After I parted them with my hands, these otherwise\\nmotionless plants would shoot right back to their original\\npositions. It was the regime of verticality.\\n\\nI soon grew accustomed to this bizarre arrangement, likewise to the\\ncomparative darkness surrounding us. The seafloor in this forest was\\nstrewn with sharp chunks of stone that were hard to avoid. Here the\\nrange of underwater flora seemed pretty comprehensive to me, as well\\nas more abundant than it might have been in the arctic or tropical\\nzones, where such exhibits are less common. But for a few minutes I\\nkept accidentally confusing the two kingdoms, mistaking zoophytes for\\nwater plants, animals for vegetables. And who hasn’t made the same\\nblunder? Flora and fauna are so closely associated in the underwater\\nworld!\\n\\nI observed that all these exhibits from the vegetable kingdom were\\nattached to the seafloor by only the most makeshift methods. They had\\nno roots and didn’t care which solid objects secured them, sand,\\nshells, husks, or pebbles; they didn’t ask their hosts for sustenance,\\njust a point of purchase. These plants are entirely self-propagating,\\nand the principle of their existence lies in the water that sustains\\nand nourishes them. In place of leaves, most of them sprouted blades\\nof unpredictable shape, which were confined to a narrow gamut of\\ncolors consisting only of pink, crimson, green, olive, tan, and\\nbrown. There I saw again, but not yet pressed and dried like the\\nNautilus’s specimens, some peacock’s tails spread open like fans to\\nstir up a cooling breeze, scarlet rosetangle, sea tangle stretching\\nout their young and edible shoots, twisting strings of kelp from the\\ngenus Nereocystis that bloomed to a height of fifteen meters, bouquets\\nof mermaid’s cups whose stems grew wider at the top, and a number of\\nother open-sea plants, all without flowers. “It’s an odd anomaly in\\nthis bizarre element!” as one witty naturalist puts it. “The animal\\nkingdom blossoms, and the vegetable kingdom doesn’t!”\\n\\nThese various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the temperate\\nzones; in the damp shade between them, there were clustered actual\\nbushes of moving flowers, hedges of zoophytes in which there grew\\nstony coral striped with twisting furrows, yellowish sea anemone from\\nthe genus Caryophylia with translucent tentacles, plus anemone with\\ngrassy tufts from the genus Zoantharia; and to complete the illusion,\\nminnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds,\\nwhile there rose underfoot, like a covey of snipe, yellow fish from\\nthe genus Lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales, flying\\ngurnards, and pinecone fish.\\n\\nNear one o’clock, Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt. Speaking for\\nmyself, I was glad to oblige, and we stretched out beneath an arbor of\\nwinged kelp, whose long thin tendrils stood up like arrows.\\n\\nThis short break was a delight. It lacked only the charm of\\nconversation. But it was impossible to speak, impossible to reply. I\\nsimply nudged my big copper headpiece against Conseil’s headpiece. I\\nsaw a happy gleam in the gallant lad’s eyes, and to communicate his\\npleasure, he jiggled around inside his carapace in the world’s\\nsilliest way.\\n\\nAfter four hours of strolling, I was quite astonished not to feel any\\nintense hunger. What kept my stomach in such a good mood I’m unable to\\nsay. But, in exchange, I experienced that irresistible desire for\\nsleep that comes over every diver. Accordingly, my eyes soon closed\\nbehind their heavy glass windows and I fell into an uncontrollable\\ndoze, which until then I had been able to fight off only through the\\nmovements of our walking. Captain Nemo and his muscular companion were\\nalready stretched out in this clear crystal, setting us a fine naptime\\nexample.\\n\\nHow long I was sunk in this torpor I cannot estimate; but when I\\nawoke, it seemed as if the sun were settling toward the\\nhorizon. Captain Nemo was already up, and I had started to stretch my\\nlimbs, when an unexpected apparition brought me sharply to my feet.\\n\\nA few paces away, a monstrous, meter-high sea spider was staring at me\\nwith beady eyes, poised to spring at me. Although my diving suit was\\nheavy enough to protect me from this animal’s bites, I couldn’t keep\\nback a shudder of horror. Just then Conseil woke up, together with the\\nNautilus’s sailor. Captain Nemo alerted his companion to this hideous\\ncrustacean, which a swing of the rifle butt quickly brought down, and\\nI watched the monster’s horrible legs writhing in dreadful\\nconvulsions.\\n\\nThis encounter reminded me that other, more daunting animals must be\\nlurking in these dark reaches, and my diving suit might not be\\nadequate protection against their attacks. Such thoughts hadn’t\\npreviously crossed my mind, and I was determined to keep on my\\nguard. Meanwhile I had assumed this rest period would be the turning\\npoint in our stroll, but I was mistaken; and instead of heading back\\nto the Nautilus, Captain Nemo continued his daring excursion.\\n\\nThe seafloor kept sinking, and its significantly steeper slope took us\\nto greater depths. It must have been nearly three o’clock when we\\nreached a narrow valley gouged between high, vertical walls and\\nlocated 150 meters down. Thanks to the perfection of our equipment, we\\nhad thus gone ninety meters below the limit that nature had, until\\nthen, set on man’s underwater excursions.\\n\\nI say 150 meters, although I had no instruments for estimating this\\ndistance. But I knew that the sun’s rays, even in the clearest seas,\\ncould reach no deeper. So at precisely this point the darkness became\\nprofound. Not a single object was visible past ten\\npaces. Consequently, I had begun to grope my way when suddenly I saw\\nthe glow of an intense white light. Captain Nemo had just activated\\nhis electric device. His companion did likewise. Conseil and I\\nfollowed suit. By turning a switch, I established contact between the\\ninduction coil and the glass spiral, and the sea, lit up by our four\\nlanterns, was illuminated for a radius of twenty-five meters.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo continued to plummet into the dark depths of this forest,\\nwhose shrubbery grew ever more sparse. I observed that vegetable life\\nwas disappearing more quickly than animal life. The open-sea plants\\nhad already left behind the increasingly arid seafloor, where a\\nprodigious number of animals were still swarming: zoophytes,\\narticulates, mollusks, and fish.\\n\\nWhile we were walking, I thought the lights of our Ruhmkorff devices\\nwould automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata. But\\nif they did approach us, at least they kept at a distance regrettable\\nfrom the hunter’s standpoint. Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop\\nand take aim with his rifle; then, after sighting down its barrel for\\na few seconds, he would straighten up and resume his walk.\\n\\nFinally, at around four o’clock, this marvelous excursion came to an\\nend. A wall of superb rocks stood before us, imposing in its sheer\\nmass: a pile of gigantic stone blocks, an enormous granite cliffside\\npitted with dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could\\nclimb up. This was the underpinning of Crespo Island. This was land.\\n\\nThe captain stopped suddenly. A gesture from him brought us to a halt,\\nand however much I wanted to clear this wall, I had to stop. Here\\nended the domains of Captain Nemo. He had no desire to pass beyond\\nthem. Farther on lay a part of the globe he would no longer tread\\nunderfoot.\\n\\nOur return journey began. Captain Nemo resumed the lead in our little\\nband, always heading forward without hesitation. I noted that we\\ndidn’t follow the same path in returning to the Nautilus. This new\\nroute, very steep and hence very arduous, quickly took us close to the\\nsurface of the sea. But this return to the upper strata wasn’t so\\nsudden that decompression took place too quickly, which could have led\\nto serious organic disorders and given us those internal injuries so\\nfatal to divers. With great promptness, the light reappeared and grew\\nstronger; and the refraction of the sun, already low on the horizon,\\nagain ringed the edges of various objects with the entire color\\nspectrum.\\n\\nAt a depth of ten meters, we walked amid a swarm of small fish from\\nevery species, more numerous than birds in the air, more agile too;\\nbut no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered to our\\neyes.\\n\\nJust then I saw the captain’s weapon spring to his shoulder and track\\na moving object through the bushes. A shot went off, I heard a faint\\nhissing, and an animal dropped a few paces away, literally struck by\\nlightning.\\n\\nIt was a magnificent sea otter from the genus Enhydra, the only\\nexclusively marine quadruped. One and a half meters long, this otter\\nhad to be worth a good high price. Its coat, chestnut brown above and\\nsilver below, would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so\\nmuch in demand in the Russian and Chinese markets; the fineness and\\nluster of its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least 2,000\\nfrancs. I was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal, with its\\ncircular head adorned by short ears, its round eyes, its white\\nwhiskers like those on a cat, its webbed and clawed feet, its bushy\\ntail. Hunted and trapped by fishermen, this valuable carnivore has\\nbecome extremely rare, and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost\\nparts of the Pacific, where in all likelihood its species will soon be\\nfacing extinction.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo’s companion picked up the animal, loaded it on his\\nshoulder, and we took to the trail again.\\n\\nFor an hour plains of sand unrolled before our steps. Often the\\nseafloor rose to within two meters of the surface of the water. I\\ncould then see our images clearly mirrored on the underside of the\\nwaves, but reflected upside down: above us there appeared an identical\\nband that duplicated our every movement and gesture; in short, a\\nperfect likeness of the quartet near which it walked, but with heads\\ndown and feet in the air.\\n\\nAnother unusual effect. Heavy clouds passed above us, forming and\\nfading swiftly. But after thinking it over, I realized that these\\nso-called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of the\\nlong ground swells, and I even spotted the foaming “white caps” that\\ntheir breaking crests were proliferating over the surface of the\\nwater. Lastly, I couldn’t help seeing the actual shadows of large\\nbirds passing over our heads, swiftly skimming the surface of the sea.\\n\\nOn this occasion I witnessed one of the finest gunshots ever to thrill\\nthe marrow of a hunter. A large bird with a wide wingspan, quite\\nclearly visible, approached and hovered over us. When it was just a\\nfew meters above the waves, Captain Nemo’s companion took aim and\\nfired. The animal dropped, electrocuted, and its descent brought it\\nwithin reach of our adroit hunter, who promptly took possession of\\nit. It was an albatross of the finest species, a wonderful specimen of\\nthese open-sea fowl.\\n\\nThis incident did not interrupt our walk. For two hours we were\\nsometimes led over plains of sand, sometimes over prairies of seaweed\\nthat were quite arduous to cross. In all honesty, I was dead tired by\\nthe time I spotted a hazy glow half a mile away, cutting through the\\ndarkness of the waters. It was the Nautilus’s beacon. Within twenty\\nminutes we would be on board, and there I could breathe easy\\nagain—because my tank’s current air supply seemed to be quite low in\\noxygen. But I was reckoning without an encounter that slightly delayed\\nour arrival.\\n\\nI was lagging behind some twenty paces when I saw Captain Nemo\\nsuddenly come back toward me. With his powerful hands he sent me\\nbuckling to the ground, while his companion did the same to\\nConseil. At first I didn’t know what to make of this sudden assault,\\nbut I was reassured to observe the captain lying motionless beside me.\\n\\nI was stretched out on the seafloor directly beneath some bushes of\\nalgae, when I raised my head and spied two enormous masses hurtling\\nby, throwing off phosphorescent glimmers.\\n\\nMy blood turned cold in my veins! I saw that we were under threat from\\na fearsome pair of sharks. They were blue sharks, dreadful man-eaters\\nwith enormous tails, dull, glassy stares, and phosphorescent matter\\noozing from holes around their snouts. They were like monstrous\\nfireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in their iron jaws! I\\ndon’t know if Conseil was busy with their classification, but as for\\nme, I looked at their silver bellies, their fearsome mouths bristling\\nwith teeth, from a viewpoint less than scientific—more as a victim\\nthan as a professor of natural history.\\n\\nLuckily these voracious animals have poor eyesight. They went by\\nwithout noticing us, grazing us with their brownish fins; and\\nmiraculously, we escaped a danger greater than encountering a tiger\\ndeep in the jungle.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, guided by its electric trail, we reached the\\nNautilus. The outside door had been left open, and Captain Nemo closed\\nit after we reentered the first cell. Then he pressed a button. I\\nheard pumps operating within the ship, I felt the water lowering\\naround me, and in a few moments the cell was completely empty. The\\ninside door opened, and we passed into the wardrobe.\\n\\nThere our diving suits were removed, not without difficulty; and\\nutterly exhausted, faint from lack of food and rest, I repaired to my\\nstateroom, full of wonder at this startling excursion on the bottom of\\nthe sea.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\nFour Thousand Leagues Under the Pacific\\n\\n\\nBY THE NEXT MORNING, November 18, I was fully recovered from my\\nexhaustion of the day before, and I climbed onto the platform just as\\nthe Nautilus’s chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase. It then\\noccurred to me that these words either referred to the state of the\\nsea, or that they meant: “There’s nothing in sight.”\\n\\nAnd in truth, the ocean was deserted. Not a sail on the horizon. The\\ntips of Crespo Island had disappeared during the night. The sea,\\nabsorbing every color of the prism except its blue rays, reflected the\\nlatter in every direction and sported a wonderful indigo tint. The\\nundulating waves regularly took on the appearance of watered silk with\\nwide stripes.\\n\\nI was marveling at this magnificent ocean view when Captain Nemo\\nappeared. He didn’t seem to notice my presence and began a series of\\nastronomical observations. Then, his operations finished, he went and\\nleaned his elbows on the beacon housing, his eyes straying over the\\nsurface of the ocean.\\n\\nMeanwhile some twenty of the Nautilus’s sailors—all energetic,\\nwell-built fellows—climbed onto the platform. They had come to pull up\\nthe nets left in our wake during the night. These seamen obviously\\nbelonged to different nationalities, although indications of European\\nphysical traits could be seen in them all. If I’m not mistaken, I\\nrecognized some Irishmen, some Frenchmen, a few Slavs, and a native of\\neither Greece or Crete. Even so, these men were frugal of speech and\\nused among themselves only that bizarre dialect whose origin I\\ncouldn’t even guess. So I had to give up any notions of questioning\\nthem.\\n\\nThe nets were hauled on board. They were a breed of trawl resembling\\nthose used off the Normandy coast, huge pouches held half open by a\\nfloating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes. Trailing in\\nthis way from these iron glove makers, the resulting receptacles\\nscoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit in their\\npath. That day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these\\nfish-filled waterways: anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them\\nfor the epithet “clowns,” black Commerson anglers equipped with their\\nantennas, undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands,\\nbloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious, some olive-hued\\nlampreys, snipefish covered with silver scales, cutlass fish whose\\nelectrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric\\nray, scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands, greenish codfish,\\nseveral varieties of goby, etc.; finally, some fish of larger\\nproportions: a one-meter jack with a prominent head, several fine\\nbonito from the genus Scomber decked out in the colors blue and\\nsilver, and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds couldn’t save\\nthem from our trawl.\\n\\nI estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000 pounds\\nof fish. It was a fine catch but not surprising. In essence, these\\nnets stayed in our wake for several hours, incarcerating an entire\\naquatic world in prisons made of thread. So we were never lacking in\\nprovisions of the highest quality, which the Nautilus’s speed and the\\nallure of its electric light could continually replenish.\\n\\nThese various exhibits from the sea were immediately lowered down the\\nhatch in the direction of the storage lockers, some to be eaten fresh,\\nothers to be preserved.\\n\\nAfter its fishing was finished and its air supply renewed, I thought\\nthe Nautilus would resume its underwater excursion, and I was getting\\nready to return to my stateroom, when Captain Nemo turned to me and\\nsaid without further preamble:\\n\\n“Look at this ocean, professor! Doesn’t it have the actual gift of\\nlife? Doesn’t it experience both anger and affection? Last evening it\\nwent to sleep just as we did, and there it is, waking up after a\\npeaceful night!”\\n\\nNo hellos or good mornings for this gent! You would have thought this\\neccentric individual was simply continuing a conversation we’d already\\nstarted!\\n\\n“See!” he went on. “It’s waking up under the sun’s caresses! It’s\\ngoing to relive its daily existence! What a fascinating field of study\\nlies in watching the play of its organism. It owns a pulse and\\narteries, it has spasms, and I side with the scholarly Commander\\nMaury, who discovered that it has a circulation as real as the\\ncirculation of blood in animals.”\\n\\nI’m sure that Captain Nemo expected no replies from me, and it seemed\\npointless to pitch in with “Ah yes,” “Exactly,” or “How right you\\nare!” Rather, he was simply talking to himself, with long pauses\\nbetween sentences. He was meditating out loud.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, “the ocean owns a genuine circulation, and to start it\\ngoing, the Creator of All Things has only to increase its heat, salt,\\nand microscopic animal life. In essence, heat creates the different\\ndensities that lead to currents and countercurrents. Evaporation,\\nwhich is nil in the High Arctic regions and very active in equatorial\\nzones, brings about a constant interchange of tropical and polar\\nwaters. What’s more, I’ve detected those falling and rising currents\\nthat make up the ocean’s true breathing. I’ve seen a molecule of salt\\nwater heat up at the surface, sink into the depths, reach maximum\\ndensity at -2 degrees centigrade, then cool off, grow lighter, and\\nrise again. At the poles you’ll see the consequences of this\\nphenomenon, and through this law of farseeing nature, you’ll\\nunderstand why water can freeze only at the surface!”\\n\\nAs the captain was finishing his sentence, I said to myself: “The\\npole! Is this brazen individual claiming he’ll take us even to that\\nlocation?”\\n\\nMeanwhile the captain fell silent and stared at the element he had\\nstudied so thoroughly and unceasingly. Then, going on:\\n\\n“Salts,” he said, “fill the sea in considerable quantities, professor,\\nand if you removed all its dissolved saline content, you’d create a\\nmass measuring 4,500,000 cubic leagues, which if it were spread all\\nover the globe, would form a layer more than ten meters high. And\\ndon’t think that the presence of these salts is due merely to some\\nwhim of nature. No. They make ocean water less open to evaporation and\\nprevent winds from carrying off excessive amounts of steam, which,\\nwhen condensing, would submerge the temperate zones. Salts play a\\nleading role, the role of stabilizer for the general ecology of the\\nglobe!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stopped, straightened up, took a few steps along the\\nplatform, and returned to me:\\n\\n“As for those billions of tiny animals,” he went on, “those infusoria\\nthat live by the millions in one droplet of water, 800,000 of which\\nare needed to weigh one milligram, their role is no less\\nimportant. They absorb the marine salts, they assimilate the solid\\nelements in the water, and since they create coral and madrepores,\\nthey’re the true builders of limestone continents! And so, after\\nthey’ve finished depriving our water drop of its mineral nutrients,\\nthe droplet gets lighter, rises to the surface, there absorbs more\\nsalts left behind through evaporation, gets heavier, sinks again, and\\nbrings those tiny animals new elements to absorb. The outcome: a\\ndouble current, rising and falling, constant movement, constant life!\\nMore intense than on land, more abundant, more infinite, such life\\nblooms in every part of this ocean, an element fatal to man, they say,\\nbut vital to myriads of animals—and to me!”\\n\\nWhen Captain Nemo spoke in this way, he was transfigured, and he\\nfilled me with extraordinary excitement.\\n\\n“There,” he added, “out there lies true existence! And I can imagine\\nthe founding of nautical towns, clusters of underwater households\\nthat, like the Nautilus, would return to the surface of the sea to\\nbreathe each morning, free towns if ever there were, independent\\ncities! Then again, who knows whether some tyrant . . .”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo finished his sentence with a vehement gesture. Then,\\naddressing me directly, as if to drive away an ugly thought:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he asked me, “do you know the depth of the ocean\\nfloor?”\\n\\n“At least, captain, I know what the major soundings tell us.”\\n\\n“Could you quote them to me, so I can double-check them as the need\\narises?”\\n\\n“Here,” I replied, “are a few of them that stick in my memory. If I’m\\nnot mistaken, an average depth of 8,200 meters was found in the north\\nAtlantic, and 2,500 meters in the Mediterranean. The most remarkable\\nsoundings were taken in the south Atlantic near the 35th parallel, and\\nthey gave 12,000 meters, 14,091 meters, and 15,149 meters. All in all,\\nit’s estimated that if the sea bottom were made level, its average\\ndepth would be about seven kilometers.”\\n\\n“Well, professor,” Captain Nemo replied, “we’ll show you better than\\nthat, I hope. As for the average depth of this part of the Pacific,\\nI’ll inform you that it’s a mere 4,000 meters.”\\n\\nThis said, Captain Nemo headed to the hatch and disappeared down the\\nladder. I followed him and went back to the main lounge. The propeller\\nwas instantly set in motion, and the log gave our speed as twenty\\nmiles per hour.\\n\\nOver the ensuing days and weeks, Captain Nemo was very frugal with his\\nvisits. I saw him only at rare intervals. His chief officer regularly\\nfixed the positions I found reported on the chart, and in such a way\\nthat I could exactly plot the Nautilus’s course.\\n\\nConseil and Land spent the long hours with me. Conseil had told his\\nfriend about the wonders of our undersea stroll, and the Canadian was\\nsorry he hadn’t gone along. But I hoped an opportunity would arise for\\na visit to the forests of Oceania.\\n\\nAlmost every day the panels in the lounge were open for some hours,\\nand our eyes never tired of probing the mysteries of the underwater\\nworld.\\n\\nThe Nautilus’s general heading was southeast, and it stayed at a depth\\nbetween 100 and 150 meters. However, from lord-knows-what whim, one\\nday it did a diagonal dive by means of its slanting fins, reaching\\nstrata located 2,000 meters underwater. The thermometer indicated a\\ntemperature of 4.25 degrees centigrade, which at this depth seemed to\\nbe a temperature common to all latitudes.\\n\\nOn November 26, at three o’clock in the morning, the Nautilus cleared\\nthe Tropic of Cancer at longitude 172 degrees. On the 27th it passed\\nin sight of the Hawaiian Islands, where the famous Captain Cook met\\nhis death on February 14, 1779. By then we had fared 4,860 leagues\\nfrom our starting point. When I arrived on the platform that morning,\\nI saw the Island of Hawaii two miles to leeward, the largest of the\\nseven islands making up this group. I could clearly distinguish the\\ntilled soil on its outskirts, the various mountain chains running\\nparallel with its coastline, and its volcanoes, crowned by Mauna Kea,\\nwhose elevation is 5,000 meters above sea level. Among other specimens\\nfrom these waterways, our nets brought up some peacock-tailed\\nflabellarian coral, polyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to\\nthis part of the ocean.\\n\\nThe Nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading. On December 1 it cut\\nthe equator at longitude 142 degrees, and on the 4th of the same\\nmonth, after a quick crossing marked by no incident, we raised the\\nMarquesas Islands. Three miles off, in latitude 8 degrees 57’ south\\nand longitude 139 degrees 32’ west, I spotted Martin Point on Nuku\\nHiva, chief member of this island group that belongs to France. I\\ncould make out only its wooded mountains on the horizon, because\\nCaptain Nemo hated to hug shore. There our nets brought up some fine\\nfish samples: dolphinfish with azure fins, gold tails, and flesh\\nthat’s unrivaled in the entire world, wrasse from the genus\\nHologymnosus that were nearly denuded of scales but exquisite in\\nflavor, knifejaws with bony beaks, yellowish albacore that were as\\ntasty as bonito, all fish worth classifying in the ship’s pantry.\\n\\nAfter leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the French\\nflag, the Nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from December 4 to the\\n11th. Its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school\\nof squid, unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the\\ncuttlefish. French fishermen give them the name “cuckoldfish,” and\\nthey belong to the class Cephalopoda, family Dibranchiata, consisting\\nof themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts. The naturalists\\nof antiquity made a special study of them, and these animals furnished\\nmany ribald figures of speech for soapbox orators in the Greek\\nmarketplace, as well as excellent dishes for the tables of rich\\ncitizens, if we’re to believe Athenaeus, a Greek physician predating\\nGalen.\\n\\nIt was during the night of December 9-10 that the Nautilus encountered\\nthis army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks. They numbered in the\\nmillions. They were migrating from the temperate zones toward zones\\nstill warmer, following the itineraries of herring and sardines. We\\nstared at them through our thick glass windows: they swam backward\\nwith tremendous speed, moving by means of their locomotive tubes,\\nchasing fish and mollusks, eating the little ones, eaten by the big\\nones, and tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature\\nhas rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic\\nsnakes. Despite its speed, the Nautilus navigated for several hours in\\nthe midst of this school of animals, and its nets brought up an\\nincalculable number, among which I recognized all nine species that\\nProfessor Orbigny has classified as native to the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\nDuring this crossing, the sea continually lavished us with the most\\nmarvelous sights. Its variety was infinite. It changed its setting and\\ndecor for the mere pleasure of our eyes, and we were called upon not\\nsimply to contemplate the works of our Creator in the midst of the\\nliquid element, but also to probe the ocean’s most daunting mysteries.\\n\\nDuring the day of December 11, I was busy reading in the main\\nlounge. Ned Land and Conseil were observing the luminous waters\\nthrough the gaping panels. The Nautilus was motionless. Its ballast\\ntanks full, it was sitting at a depth of 1,000 meters in a\\ncomparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger fish\\nput in occasional appearances.\\n\\nJust then I was studying a delightful book by Jean MacΘ, The Servants\\nof the Stomach, and savoring its ingenious teachings, when Conseil\\ninterrupted my reading.\\n\\n“Would master kindly come here for an instant?” he said to me in an\\nodd voice.\\n\\n“What is it, Conseil?”\\n\\n“It’s something that master should see.”\\n\\nI stood up, went, leaned on my elbows before the window, and I saw it.\\n\\nIn the broad electric daylight, an enormous black mass, quite\\nmotionless, hung suspended in the midst of the waters. I observed it\\ncarefully, trying to find out the nature of this gigantic\\ncetacean. Then a sudden thought crossed my mind.\\n\\n“A ship!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes,” the Canadian replied, “a disabled craft that’s sinking straight\\ndown!”\\n\\nNed Land was not mistaken. We were in the presence of a ship whose\\nsevered shrouds still hung from their clasps. Its hull looked in good\\ncondition, and it must have gone under only a few hours before. The\\nstumps of three masts, chopped off two feet above the deck, indicated\\na flooding ship that had been forced to sacrifice its masting. But it\\nhad heeled sideways, filling completely, and it was listing to port\\neven yet. A sorry sight, this carcass lost under the waves, but\\nsorrier still was the sight on its deck, where, lashed with ropes to\\nprevent their being washed overboard, some human corpses still lay! I\\ncounted four of them—four men, one still standing at the helm—then a\\nwoman, halfway out of a skylight on the afterdeck, holding a child in\\nher arms. This woman was young. Under the brilliant lighting of the\\nNautilus’s rays, I could make out her features, which the water hadn’t\\nyet decomposed. With a supreme effort, she had lifted her child above\\nher head, and the poor little creature’s arms were still twined around\\nits mother’s neck! The postures of the four seamen seemed ghastly to\\nme, twisted from convulsive movements, as if making a last effort to\\nbreak loose from the ropes that bound them to their ship. And the\\nhelmsman, standing alone, calmer, his face smooth and serious, his\\ngrizzled hair plastered to his brow, his hands clutching the wheel,\\nseemed even yet to be guiding his wrecked three-master through the\\nocean depths!\\n\\nWhat a scene! We stood dumbstruck, hearts pounding, before this\\nshipwreck caught in the act, as if it had been photographed in its\\nfinal moments, so to speak! And already I could see enormous sharks\\nmoving in, eyes ablaze, drawn by the lure of human flesh!\\n\\nMeanwhile, turning, the Nautilus made a circle around the sinking\\nship, and for an instant I could read the board on its stern:\\n\\nThe Florida Sunderland, England\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\nVanikoro\\n\\n\\nTHIS DREADFUL SIGHT was the first of a whole series of maritime\\ncatastrophes that the Nautilus would encounter on its run. When it\\nplied more heavily traveled seas, we often saw wrecked hulls rotting\\nin midwater, and farther down, cannons, shells, anchors, chains, and a\\nthousand other iron objects rusting away.\\n\\nMeanwhile, continuously swept along by the Nautilus, where we lived in\\nnear isolation, we raised the Tuamotu Islands on December 11, that old\\n“dangerous group” associated with the French global navigator\\nCommander Bougainville; it stretches from Ducie Island to Lazareff\\nIsland over an area of 500 leagues from the east-southeast to the\\nwest-northwest, between latitude 13 degrees 30’ and 23 degrees 50’\\nsouth, and between longitude 125 degrees 30’ and 151 degrees 30’\\nwest. This island group covers a surface area of 370 square leagues,\\nand it’s made up of some sixty subgroups, among which we noted the\\nGambier group, which is a French protectorate. These islands are coral\\nformations. Thanks to the work of polyps, a slow but steady upheaval\\nwill someday connect these islands to each other. Later on, this new\\nisland will be fused to its neighboring island groups, and a fifth\\ncontinent will stretch from New Zealand and New Caledonia as far as\\nthe Marquesas Islands.\\n\\nThe day I expounded this theory to Captain Nemo, he answered me\\ncoldly:\\n\\n“The earth doesn’t need new continents, but new men!”\\n\\nSailors’ luck led the Nautilus straight to Reao Island, one of the\\nmost unusual in this group, which was discovered in 1822 by Captain\\nBell aboard the Minerva. So I was able to study the madreporic process\\nthat has created the islands in this ocean.\\n\\nMadrepores, which one must guard against confusing with precious\\ncoral, clothe their tissue in a limestone crust, and their variations\\nin structure have led my famous mentor Professor Milne-Edwards to\\nclassify them into five divisions. The tiny microscopic animals that\\nsecrete this polypary live by the billions in the depths of their\\ncells. Their limestone deposits build up into rocks, reefs, islets,\\nislands. In some places, they form atolls, a circular ring surrounding\\na lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with the\\nsea. Elsewhere, they take the shape of barrier reefs, such as those\\nthat exist along the coasts of New Caledonia and several of the\\nTuamotu Islands. In still other localities, such as RΘunion Island and\\nthe island of Mauritius, they build fringing reefs, high, straight\\nwalls next to which the ocean’s depth is considerable.\\n\\nWhile cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning of\\nReao Island, I marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished by\\nthese microscopic laborers. These walls were the express achievements\\nof madrepores known by the names fire coral, finger coral, star coral,\\nand stony coral. These polyps grow exclusively in the agitated strata\\nat the surface of the sea, and so it’s in the upper reaches that they\\nbegin these substructures, which sink little by little together with\\nthe secreted rubble binding them. This, at least, is the theory of\\nMr. Charles Darwin, who thus explains the formation of atolls—a theory\\nsuperior, in my view, to the one that says these madreporic edifices\\nsit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet\\nbelow sea level.\\n\\nI could observe these strange walls quite closely: our sounding lines\\nindicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters,\\nand our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle.\\n\\nIn reply to a question Conseil asked me about the growth rate of these\\ncolossal barriers, I thoroughly amazed him by saying that scientists\\nput it at an eighth of an inch per biennium.\\n\\n“Therefore,” he said to me, “to build these walls, it took . . . ?”\\n\\n“192,000 years, my gallant Conseil, which significantly extends the\\nbiblical Days of Creation. What’s more, the formation of coal—in other\\nwords, the petrification of forests swallowed by floods—and the\\ncooling of basaltic rocks likewise call for a much longer period of\\ntime. I might add that those ‘days’ in the Bible must represent whole\\nepochs and not literally the lapse of time between two sunrises,\\nbecause according to the Bible itself, the sun doesn’t date from the\\nfirst day of Creation.”\\n\\nWhen the Nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean, I could take\\nin Reao Island over its whole flat, wooded expanse. Obviously its\\nmadreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and\\nthunderstorms. One day, carried off by a hurricane from neighboring\\nshores, some seed fell onto these limestone beds, mixing with\\ndecomposed particles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable\\nhumus. Propelled by the waves, a coconut arrived on this new\\ncoast. Its germ took root. Its tree grew tall, catching steam off the\\nwater. A brook was born. Little by little, vegetation spread. Tiny\\nanimals—worms, insects—rode ashore on tree trunks snatched from\\nislands to windward. Turtles came to lay their eggs. Birds nested in\\nthe young trees. In this way animal life developed, and drawn by the\\ngreenery and fertile soil, man appeared. And that’s how these islands\\nwere formed, the immense achievement of microscopic animals.\\n\\nNear evening Reao Island melted into the distance, and the Nautilus\\nnoticeably changed course. After touching the Tropic of Capricorn at\\nlongitude 135 degrees, it headed west-northwest, going back up the\\nwhole intertropical zone. Although the summer sun lavished its rays on\\nus, we never suffered from the heat, because thirty or forty meters\\nunderwater, the temperature didn’t go over 10 degrees to 12 degrees\\ncentigrade.\\n\\nBy December 15 we had left the alluring Society Islands in the west,\\nlikewise elegant Tahiti, queen of the Pacific. In the morning I\\nspotted this island’s lofty summits a few miles to leeward. Its waters\\nsupplied excellent fish for the tables on board: mackerel, bonito,\\nalbacore, and a few varieties of that sea serpent named the moray eel.\\n\\nThe Nautilus had cleared 8,100 miles. We logged 9,720 miles when we\\npassed between the Tonga Islands, where crews from the Argo,\\nPort-au-Prince, and Duke of Portland had perished, and the island\\ngroup of Samoa, scene of the slaying of Captain de Langle, friend of\\nthat long-lost navigator, the Count de La PΘrouse. Then we raised the\\nFiji Islands, where savages slaughtered sailors from the Union, as\\nwell as Captain Bureau, commander of the Darling Josephine out of\\nNantes, France.\\n\\nExtending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south, and over 90\\nleagues east to west, this island group lies between latitude 2\\ndegrees and 6 degrees south, and between longitude 174 degrees and 179\\ndegrees west. It consists of a number of islands, islets, and reefs,\\namong which we noted the islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Kadavu.\\n\\nIt was the Dutch navigator Tasman who discovered this group in 1643,\\nthe same year the Italian physicist Torricelli invented the barometer\\nand King Louis XIV ascended the French throne. I’ll let the reader\\ndecide which of these deeds was more beneficial to humanity. Coming\\nlater, Captain Cook in 1774, Rear Admiral d’Entrecasteaux in 1793, and\\nfinally Captain Dumont d’Urville in 1827, untangled the whole chaotic\\ngeography of this island group. The Nautilus drew near Wailea Bay, an\\nunlucky place for England’s Captain Dillon, who was the first to shed\\nlight on the longstanding mystery surrounding the disappearance of\\nships under the Count de La PΘrouse.\\n\\nThis bay, repeatedly dredged, furnished a huge supply of excellent\\noysters. As the Roman playwright Seneca recommended, we opened them\\nright at our table, then stuffed ourselves. These mollusks belonged to\\nthe species known by name as Ostrea lamellosa, whose members are quite\\ncommon off Corsica. This Wailea oysterbank must have been extensive,\\nand for certain, if they hadn’t been controlled by numerous natural\\nchecks, these clusters of shellfish would have ended up jam-packing\\nthe bay, since as many as 2,000,000 eggs have been counted in a single\\nindividual.\\n\\nAnd if Mr. Ned Land did not repent of his gluttony at our oyster fest,\\nit’s because oysters are the only dish that never causes\\nindigestion. In fact, it takes no less than sixteen dozen of these\\nheadless mollusks to supply the 315 grams that satisfy one man’s\\nminimum daily requirement for nitrogen.\\n\\nOn December 25 the Nautilus navigated amid the island group of the New\\nHebrides, which the Portuguese seafarer Queir≤s discovered in 1606,\\nwhich Commander Bougainville explored in 1768, and to which Captain\\nCook gave its current name in 1773. This group is chiefly made up of\\nnine large islands and forms a 120-league strip from the\\nnorth-northwest to the south-southeast, lying between latitude 2\\ndegrees and 15 degrees south, and between longitude 164 degrees and\\n168 degrees. At the moment of our noon sights, we passed fairly close\\nto the island of Aurou, which looked to me like a mass of green woods\\ncrowned by a peak of great height.\\n\\nThat day it was yuletide, and it struck me that Ned Land badly missed\\ncelebrating “Christmas,” that genuine family holiday where Protestants\\nare such zealots.\\n\\nI hadn’t seen Captain Nemo for over a week, when, on the morning of\\nthe 27th, he entered the main lounge, as usual acting as if he’d been\\ngone for just five minutes. I was busy tracing the Nautilus’s course\\non the world map. The captain approached, placed a finger over a\\nposition on the chart, and pronounced just one word:\\n\\n“Vanikoro.”\\n\\nThis name was magic! It was the name of those islets where vessels\\nunder the Count de La PΘrouse had miscarried. I straightened suddenly.\\n\\n“The Nautilus is bringing us to Vanikoro?” I asked.\\n\\n“Yes, professor,” the captain replied.\\n\\n“And I’ll be able to visit those famous islands where the Compass and\\nthe Astrolabe came to grief?”\\n\\n“If you like, professor.”\\n\\n“When will we reach Vanikoro?”\\n\\n“We already have, professor.”\\n\\nFollowed by Captain Nemo, I climbed onto the platform, and from there\\nmy eyes eagerly scanned the horizon.\\n\\nIn the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size,\\nsurrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles. We were\\nfacing the island of Vanikoro proper, to which Captain Dumont\\nd’Urville had given the name “Island of the Search”; we lay right in\\nfront of the little harbor of Vana, located in latitude 16 degrees 4’\\nsouth and longitude 164 degrees 32’ east. Its shores seemed covered\\nwith greenery from its beaches to its summits inland, crowned by\\nMt. Kapogo, which is 476 fathoms high.\\n\\nAfter clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway, the\\nNautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty\\nto forty fathoms. Under the green shade of some tropical evergreens, I\\nspotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our\\napproach. In this long, blackish object advancing flush with the\\nwater, didn’t they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged\\nto view with distrust?\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the shipwreck of the\\nCount de La PΘrouse.\\n\\n“What everybody knows, captain,” I answered him.\\n\\n“And could you kindly tell me what everybody knows?” he asked me in a\\ngently ironic tone.\\n\\n“Very easily.”\\n\\nI related to him what the final deeds of Captain Dumont d’Urville had\\nbrought to light, deeds described here in this heavily condensed\\nsummary of the whole matter.\\n\\nIn 1785 the Count de La PΘrouse and his subordinate, Captain de\\nLangle, were sent by King Louis XVI of France on a voyage to\\ncircumnavigate the globe. They boarded two sloops of war, the Compass\\nand the Astrolabe, which were never seen again.\\n\\nIn 1791, justly concerned about the fate of these two sloops of war,\\nthe French government fitted out two large cargo boats, the Search and\\nthe Hope, which left Brest on September 28 under orders from Rear\\nAdmiral Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. Two months later, testimony from a\\ncertain Commander Bowen, aboard the Albemarle, alleged that rubble\\nfrom shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coast of New\\nGeorgia. But d’Entrecasteaux was unaware of this news—which seemed a\\nbit dubious anyhow—and headed toward the Admiralty Islands, which had\\nbeen named in a report by one Captain Hunter as the site of the Count\\nde La PΘrouse’s shipwreck.\\n\\nThey looked in vain. The Hope and the Search passed right by Vanikoro\\nwithout stopping there; and overall, this voyage was plagued by\\nmisfortune, ultimately costing the lives of Rear Admiral\\nd’Entrecasteaux, two of his subordinate officers, and several seamen\\nfrom his crew.\\n\\nIt was an old hand at the Pacific, the English adventurer Captain\\nPeter Dillon, who was the first to pick up the trail left by castaways\\nfrom the wrecked vessels. On May 15, 1824, his ship, the St. Patrick,\\npassed by Tikopia Island, one of the New Hebrides. There a native\\nboatman pulled alongside in a dugout canoe and sold Dillon a silver\\nsword hilt bearing the imprint of characters engraved with a cutting\\ntool known as a burin. Furthermore, this native boatman claimed that\\nduring a stay in Vanikoro six years earlier, he had seen two Europeans\\nbelonging to ships that had run aground on the island’s reefs many\\nyears before.\\n\\nDillon guessed that the ships at issue were those under the Count de\\nLa PΘrouse, ships whose disappearance had shaken the entire world. He\\ntried to reach Vanikoro, where, according to the native boatman, a\\ngood deal of rubble from the shipwreck could still be found, but winds\\nand currents prevented his doing so.\\n\\nDillon returned to Calcutta. There he was able to interest the Asiatic\\nSociety and the East India Company in his discovery. A ship named\\nafter the Search was placed at his disposal, and he departed on\\nJanuary 23, 1827, accompanied by a French deputy.\\n\\nThis new Search, after putting in at several stops over the Pacific,\\ndropped anchor before Vanikoro on July 7, 1827, in the same harbor of\\nVana where the Nautilus was currently floating.\\n\\nThere Dillon collected many relics of the shipwreck: iron utensils,\\nanchors, eyelets from pulleys, swivel guns, an eighteen-pound shell,\\nthe remains of some astronomical instruments, a piece of sternrail,\\nand a bronze bell bearing the inscription “Made by Bazin,” the foundry\\nmark at Brest Arsenal around 1785. There could no longer be any doubt.\\n\\nFinishing his investigations, Dillon stayed at the site of the\\ncasualty until the month of October. Then he left Vanikoro, headed\\ntoward New Zealand, dropped anchor at Calcutta on April 7, 1828, and\\nreturned to France, where he received a very cordial welcome from King\\nCharles X.\\n\\nBut just then the renowned French explorer Captain Dumont d’Urville,\\nunaware of Dillon’s activities, had already set sail to search\\nelsewhere for the site of the shipwreck. In essence, a whaling vessel\\nhad reported that some medals and a Cross of St. Louis had been found\\nin the hands of savages in the Louisiade Islands and New Caledonia.\\n\\nSo Captain Dumont d’Urville had put to sea in command of a vessel\\nnamed after the Astrolabe, and just two months after Dillon had left\\nVanikoro, Dumont d’Urville dropped anchor before Hobart. There he\\nheard about Dillon’s findings, and he further learned that a certain\\nJames Hobbs, chief officer on the Union out of Calcutta, had put to\\nshore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18’ south and\\nlongitude 156 degrees 30’ east, and had noted the natives of those\\nwaterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics.\\n\\nPretty perplexed, Dumont d’Urville didn’t know if he should give\\ncredence to these reports, which had been carried in some of the less\\nreliable newspapers; nevertheless, he decided to start on Dillon’s\\ntrail.\\n\\nOn February 10, 1828, the new Astrolabe hove before Tikopia Island,\\ntook on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had\\nsettled there, plied a course toward Vanikoro, raised it on February\\n12, sailed along its reefs until the 14th, and only on the 20th\\ndropped anchor inside its barrier in the harbor of Vana.\\n\\nOn the 23rd, several officers circled the island and brought back some\\nrubble of little importance. The natives, adopting a system of denial\\nand evasion, refused to guide them to the site of the casualty. This\\nrather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives had\\nmistreated the castaways; and in truth, the natives seemed afraid that\\nDumont d’Urville had come to avenge the Count de La PΘrouse and his\\nunfortunate companions.\\n\\nBut on the 26th, appeased with gifts and seeing that they didn’t need\\nto fear any reprisals, the natives led the chief officer,\\nMr. Jacquinot, to the site of the shipwreck.\\n\\nAt this location, in three or four fathoms of water between the Paeu\\nand Vana reefs, there lay some anchors, cannons, and ingots of iron\\nand lead, all caked with limestone concretions. A launch and whaleboat\\nfrom the new Astrolabe were steered to this locality, and after going\\nto exhausting lengths, their crews managed to dredge up an anchor\\nweighing 1,800 pounds, a cast-iron eight-pounder cannon, a lead ingot,\\nand two copper swivel guns.\\n\\nQuestioning the natives, Captain Dumont d’Urville also learned that\\nafter La PΘrouse’s two ships had miscarried on the island’s reefs, the\\ncount had built a smaller craft, only to go off and miscarry a second\\ntime. Where? Nobody knew.\\n\\nThe commander of the new Astrolabe then had a monument erected under a\\ntuft of mangrove, in memory of the famous navigator and his\\ncompanions. It was a simple quadrangular pyramid, set on a coral base,\\nwith no ironwork to tempt the natives’ avarice.\\n\\nThen Dumont d’Urville tried to depart; but his crews were run down\\nfrom the fevers raging on these unsanitary shores, and quite ill\\nhimself, he was unable to weigh anchor until March 17.\\n\\nMeanwhile, fearing that Dumont d’Urville wasn’t abreast of Dillon’s\\nactivities, the French government sent a sloop of war to Vanikoro, the\\nBayonnaise under Commander Legoarant de Tromelin, who had been\\nstationed on the American west coast. Dropping anchor before Vanikoro\\na few months after the new Astrolabe’s departure, the Bayonnaise\\ndidn’t find any additional evidence but verified that the savages\\nhadn’t disturbed the memorial honoring the Count de La PΘrouse.\\n\\nThis is the substance of the account I gave Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“So,” he said to me, “the castaways built a third ship on Vanikoro\\nIsland, and to this day, nobody knows where it went and perished?”\\n\\n“Nobody knows.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo didn’t reply but signaled me to follow him to the main\\nlounge. The Nautilus sank a few meters beneath the waves, and the\\npanels opened.\\n\\nI rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral: fungus coral,\\nsiphonula coral, alcyon coral, sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia,\\nplus myriads of charming fish including greenfish, damselfish,\\nsweepers, snappers, and squirrelfish; underneath this coral covering I\\ndetected some rubble the old dredges hadn’t been able to tear\\nfree—iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, shells, tackle from a capstan, a\\nstempost, all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now carpeted\\nin moving flowers.\\n\\nAnd as I stared at this desolate wreckage, Captain Nemo told me in a\\nsolemn voice:\\n\\n“Commander La PΘrouse set out on December 7, 1785, with his ships, the\\nCompass and the Astrolabe. He dropped anchor first at Botany Bay,\\nvisited the Tonga Islands and New Caledonia, headed toward the Santa\\nCruz Islands, and put in at Nomuka, one of the islands in the Ha’apai\\ngroup. Then his ships arrived at the unknown reefs of\\nVanikoro. Traveling in the lead, the Compass ran afoul of breakers on\\nthe southerly coast. The Astrolabe went to its rescue and also ran\\naground. The first ship was destroyed almost immediately. The second,\\nstranded to leeward, held up for some days. The natives gave the\\ncastaways a fair enough welcome. The latter took up residence on the\\nisland and built a smaller craft with rubble from the two large\\nones. A few seamen stayed voluntarily in Vanikoro. The others, weak\\nand ailing, set sail with the Count de La PΘrouse. They headed to the\\nSolomon Islands, and they perished with all hands on the westerly\\ncoast of the chief island in that group, between Cape Deception and\\nCape Satisfaction!”\\n\\n“And how do you know all this?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Here’s what I found at the very site of that final shipwreck!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo showed me a tin box, stamped with the coat of arms of\\nFrance and all corroded by salt water. He opened it and I saw a bundle\\nof papers, yellowed but still legible.\\n\\nThey were the actual military orders given by France’s Minister of the\\nNavy to Commander La PΘrouse, with notes along the margin in the\\nhandwriting of King Louis XVI!\\n\\n“Ah, what a splendid death for a seaman!” Captain Nemo then said. “A\\ncoral grave is a tranquil grave, and may Heaven grant that my\\ncompanions and I rest in no other!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\nThe Torres Strait\\n\\n\\nDURING THE NIGHT of December 27-28, the Nautilus left the waterways of\\nVanikoro behind with extraordinary speed. Its heading was\\nsouthwesterly, and in three days it had cleared the 750 leagues that\\nseparated La PΘrouse’s islands from the southeastern tip of Papua.\\n\\nOn January 1, 1868, bright and early, Conseil joined me on the\\nplatform.\\n\\n“Will master,” the gallant lad said to me, “allow me to wish him a\\nhappy new year?”\\n\\n“Good heavens, Conseil, it’s just like old times in my office at the\\nBotanical Gardens in Paris! I accept your kind wishes and I thank you\\nfor them. Only, I’d like to know what you mean by a ‘happy year’ under\\nthe circumstances in which we’re placed. Is it a year that will bring\\nour imprisonment to an end, or a year that will see this strange\\nvoyage continue?”\\n\\n“Ye gods,” Conseil replied, “I hardly know what to tell master. We’re\\ncertainly seeing some unusual things, and for two months we’ve had no\\ntime for boredom. The latest wonder is always the most astonishing,\\nand if this progression keeps up, I can’t imagine what its climax will\\nbe. In my opinion, we’ll never again have such an opportunity.”\\n\\n“Never, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Besides, Mr. Nemo really lives up to his Latin name, since he\\ncouldn’t be less in the way if he didn’t exist.”\\n\\n“True enough, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Therefore, with all due respect to master, I think a ‘happy year’\\nwould be a year that lets us see everything—”\\n\\n“Everything, Conseil? No year could be that long. But what does Ned\\nLand think about all this?”\\n\\n“Ned Land’s thoughts are exactly the opposite of mine,” Conseil\\nreplied. “He has a practical mind and a demanding stomach. He’s tired\\nof staring at fish and eating them day in and day out. This shortage\\nof wine, bread, and meat isn’t suitable for an upstanding Anglo-Saxon,\\na man accustomed to beefsteak and unfazed by regular doses of brandy\\nor gin!”\\n\\n“For my part, Conseil, that doesn’t bother me in the least, and I’ve\\nadjusted very nicely to the diet on board.”\\n\\n“So have I,” Conseil replied. “Accordingly, I think as much about\\nstaying as Mr. Land about making his escape. Thus, if this new year\\nisn’t a happy one for me, it will be for him, and vice versa. No\\nmatter what happens, one of us will be pleased. So, in conclusion, I\\nwish master to have whatever his heart desires.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Conseil. Only I must ask you to postpone the question of\\nnew year’s gifts, and temporarily accept a hearty handshake in their\\nplace. That’s all I have on me.”\\n\\n“Master has never been more generous,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAnd with that, the gallant lad went away.\\n\\nBy January 2 we had fared 11,340 miles, hence 5,250 leagues, from our\\nstarting point in the seas of Japan. Before the Nautilus’s spur there\\nstretched the dangerous waterways of the Coral Sea, off the northeast\\ncoast of Australia. Our boat cruised along a few miles away from that\\ndaunting shoal where Captain Cook’s ships wellnigh miscarried on June\\n10, 1770. The craft that Cook was aboard charged into some coral rock,\\nand if his vessel didn’t go down, it was thanks to the circumstance\\nthat a piece of coral broke off in the collision and plugged the very\\nhole it had made in the hull.\\n\\nI would have been deeply interested in visiting this long, 360-league\\nreef, against which the ever-surging sea broke with the fearsome\\nintensity of thunderclaps. But just then the Nautilus’s slanting fins\\ntook us to great depths, and I could see nothing of those high coral\\nwalls. I had to rest content with the various specimens of fish\\nbrought up by our nets. Among others I noted some long-finned\\nalbacore, a species in the genus Scomber, as big as tuna, bluish on\\nthe flanks, and streaked with crosswise stripes that disappear when\\nthe animal dies. These fish followed us in schools and supplied our\\ntable with very dainty flesh. We also caught a large number of\\nyellow-green gilthead, half a decimeter long and tasting like dorado,\\nplus some flying gurnards, authentic underwater swallows that, on dark\\nnights, alternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent\\nglimmers. Among mollusks and zoophytes, I found in our trawl’s meshes\\nvarious species of alcyonarian coral, sea urchins, hammer shells,\\nspurred-star shells, wentletrap snails, horn shells, glass snails. The\\nlocal flora was represented by fine floating algae: sea tangle, and\\nkelp from the genus Macrocystis, saturated with the mucilage their\\npores perspire, from which I selected a wonderful Nemastoma\\ngeliniaroidea, classifying it with the natural curiosities in the\\nmuseum.\\n\\nOn January 4, two days after crossing the Coral Sea, we raised the\\ncoast of Papua. On this occasion Captain Nemo told me that he intended\\nto reach the Indian Ocean via the Torres Strait. This was the extent\\nof his remarks. Ned saw with pleasure that this course would bring us,\\nonce again, closer to European seas.\\n\\nThe Torres Strait is regarded as no less dangerous for its bristling\\nreefs than for the savage inhabitants of its coasts. It separates\\nQueensland from the huge island of Papua, also called New Guinea.\\n\\nPapua is 400 leagues long by 130 leagues wide, with a surface area of\\n40,000 geographic leagues. It’s located between latitude 0 degrees 19’\\nand 10 degrees 2’ south, and between longitude 128 degrees 23’ and 146\\ndegrees 15’. At noon, while the chief officer was taking the sun’s\\naltitude, I spotted the summits of the Arfak Mountains, rising in\\nterraces and ending in sharp peaks.\\n\\nDiscovered in 1511 by the Portuguese Francisco Serrano, these shores\\nwere successively visited by Don Jorge de Meneses in 1526, by Juan de\\nGrijalva in 1527, by the Spanish general Alvaro de Saavedra in 1528,\\nby Inigo Ortiz in 1545, by the Dutchman Schouten in 1616, by Nicolas\\nSruick in 1753, by Tasman, Dampier, Fumel, Carteret, Edwards,\\nBougainville, Cook, McClure, and Thomas Forrest, by Rear Admiral\\nd’Entrecasteaux in 1792, by Louis-Isidore Duperrey in 1823, and by\\nCaptain Dumont d’Urville in 1827. “It’s the heartland of the blacks\\nwho occupy all Malaysia,” Mr. de Rienzi has said; and I hadn’t the\\nfoggiest inkling that sailors’ luck was about to bring me face to face\\nwith these daunting Andaman aborigines.\\n\\nSo the Nautilus hove before the entrance to the world’s most dangerous\\nstrait, a passageway that even the boldest navigators hesitated to\\nclear: the strait that Luis Vaez de Torres faced on returning from the\\nSouth Seas in Melanesia, the strait in which sloops of war under\\nCaptain Dumont d’Urville ran aground in 1840 and nearly miscarried\\nwith all hands. And even the Nautilus, rising superior to every danger\\nin the sea, was about to become intimate with its coral reefs.\\n\\nThe Torres Strait is about thirty-four leagues wide, but it’s\\nobstructed by an incalculable number of islands, islets, breakers, and\\nrocks that make it nearly impossible to navigate. Consequently,\\nCaptain Nemo took every desired precaution in crossing it. Floating\\nflush with the water, the Nautilus moved ahead at a moderate\\npace. Like a cetacean’s tail, its propeller churned the waves slowly.\\n\\nTaking advantage of this situation, my two companions and I found\\nseats on the ever-deserted platform. In front of us stood the\\npilothouse, and unless I’m extremely mistaken, Captain Nemo must have\\nbeen inside, steering his Nautilus himself.\\n\\nUnder my eyes I had the excellent charts of the Torres Strait that had\\nbeen surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer Vincendon\\nDumoulin and Sublieutenant (now Admiral) Coupvent-Desbois, who were\\npart of Dumont d’Urville’s general staff during his final voyage to\\ncircumnavigate the globe. These, along with the efforts of Captain\\nKing, are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this narrow\\npassageway, and I consulted them with scrupulous care.\\n\\nAround the Nautilus the sea was boiling furiously. A stream of waves,\\nbearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half miles\\nper hour, broke over heads of coral emerging here and there.\\n\\n“That’s one rough sea!” Ned Land told me.\\n\\n“Abominable indeed,” I replied, “and hardly suitable for a craft like\\nthe Nautilus.”\\n\\n“That damned captain,” the Canadian went on, “must really be sure of\\nhis course, because if these clumps of coral so much as brush us,\\nthey’ll rip our hull into a thousand pieces!”\\n\\nThe situation was indeed dangerous, but as if by magic, the Nautilus\\nseemed to glide right down the middle of these rampaging reefs. It\\ndidn’t follow the exact course of the Zealous and the new Astrolabe,\\nwhich had proved so ill-fated for Captain Dumont d’Urville. It went\\nmore to the north, hugged the Murray Islands, and returned to the\\nsouthwest near Cumberland Passage. I thought it was about to charge\\nwholeheartedly into this opening, but it went up to the northwest,\\nthrough a large number of little-known islands and islets, and steered\\ntoward Tound Island and the Bad Channel.\\n\\nI was already wondering if Captain Nemo, rash to the point of sheer\\ninsanity, wanted his ship to tackle the narrows where Dumont\\nd’Urville’s two sloops of war had gone aground, when he changed\\ndirection a second time and cut straight to the west, heading toward\\nGueboroa Island.\\n\\nBy then it was three o’clock in the afternoon. The current was\\nslacking off, it was almost full tide. The Nautilus drew near this\\nisland, which I can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of\\nscrew pines. We hugged it from less than two miles out.\\n\\nA sudden jolt threw me down. The Nautilus had just struck a reef, and\\nit remained motionless, listing slightly to port.\\n\\nWhen I stood up, I saw Captain Nemo and his chief officer on the\\nplatform. They were examining the ship’s circumstances, exchanging a\\nfew words in their incomprehensible dialect.\\n\\nHere is what those circumstances entailed. Two miles to starboard lay\\nGueboroa Island, its coastline curving north to west like an immense\\narm. To the south and east, heads of coral were already on display,\\nleft uncovered by the ebbing waters. We had run aground at full tide\\nand in one of those seas whose tides are moderate, an inconvenient\\nstate of affairs for floating the Nautilus off. However, the ship\\nhadn’t suffered in any way, so solidly joined was its hull. But\\nalthough it could neither sink nor split open, it was in serious\\ndanger of being permanently attached to these reefs, and that would\\nhave been the finish of Captain Nemo’s submersible.\\n\\nI was mulling this over when the captain approached, cool and calm,\\nforever in control of himself, looking neither alarmed nor annoyed.\\n\\n“An accident?” I said to him.\\n\\n“No, an incident,” he answered me.\\n\\n“But an incident,” I replied, “that may oblige you to become a\\nresident again of these shores you avoid!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo gave me an odd look and gestured no. Which told me pretty\\nclearly that nothing would ever force him to set foot on a land mass\\nagain. Then he said:\\n\\n“No, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus isn’t consigned to perdition. It\\nwill still carry you through the midst of the ocean’s wonders. Our\\nvoyage is just beginning, and I’ve no desire to deprive myself so soon\\nof the pleasure of your company.”\\n\\n“Even so, Captain Nemo,” I went on, ignoring his ironic turn of\\nphrase, “the Nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is\\nfull. Now then, the tides aren’t strong in the Pacific, and if you\\ncan’t unballast the Nautilus, which seems impossible to me, I don’t\\nsee how it will float off.”\\n\\n“You’re right, professor, the Pacific tides aren’t strong,” Captain\\nNemo replied. “But in the Torres Strait, one still finds a\\nmeter-and-a-half difference in level between high and low seas. Today\\nis January 4, and in five days the moon will be full. Now then, I’ll\\nbe quite astonished if that good-natured satellite doesn’t\\nsufficiently raise these masses of water and do me a favor for which\\nI’ll be forever grateful.”\\n\\nThis said, Captain Nemo went below again to the Nautilus’s interior,\\nfollowed by his chief officer. As for our craft, it no longer stirred,\\nstaying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled it\\nin with their indestructible cement.\\n\\n“Well, sir?” Ned Land said to me, coming up after the captain’s\\ndeparture.\\n\\n“Well, Ned my friend, we’ll serenely wait for the tide on the 9th,\\nbecause it seems the moon will have the good nature to float us away!”\\n\\n“As simple as that?”\\n\\n“As simple as that.”\\n\\n“So our captain isn’t going to drop his anchors, put his engines on\\nthe chains, and do anything to haul us off?”\\n\\n“Since the tide will be sufficient,” Conseil replied simply.\\n\\nThe Canadian stared at Conseil, then he shrugged his shoulders. The\\nseaman in him was talking now.\\n\\n“Sir,” he answered, “you can trust me when I say this hunk of iron\\nwill never navigate again, on the seas or under them. It’s only fit to\\nbe sold for its weight. So I think it’s time we gave Captain Nemo the\\nslip.”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I replied, “unlike you, I haven’t given up on our\\nvaliant Nautilus, and in four days we’ll know where we stand on these\\nPacific tides. Besides, an escape attempt might be timely if we were\\nin sight of the coasts of England or Provence, but in the waterways of\\nPapua it’s another story. And we’ll always have that as a last resort\\nif the Nautilus doesn’t right itself, which I’d regard as a real\\ncalamity.”\\n\\n“But couldn’t we at least get the lay of the land?” Ned went\\non. “Here’s an island. On this island there are trees. Under those\\ntrees land animals loaded with cutlets and roast beef, which I’d be\\nhappy to sink my teeth into.”\\n\\n“In this instance our friend Ned is right,” Conseil said, “and I side\\nwith his views. Couldn’t master persuade his friend Captain Nemo to\\nsend the three of us ashore, if only so our feet don’t lose the knack\\nof treading on the solid parts of our planet?”\\n\\n“I can ask him,” I replied, “but he’ll refuse.”\\n\\n“Let master take the risk,” Conseil said, “and we’ll know where we\\nstand on the captain’s affability.”\\n\\nMuch to my surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,\\nand he did so with grace and alacrity, not even exacting my promise to\\nreturn on board. But fleeing across the New Guinea territories would\\nbe extremely dangerous, and I wouldn’t have advised Ned Land to try\\nit. Better to be prisoners aboard the Nautilus than to fall into the\\nhands of Papuan natives.\\n\\nThe skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning. I hardly\\nneeded to ask whether Captain Nemo would be coming along. I likewise\\nassumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us, that Ned Land would\\nbe in sole charge of piloting the longboat. Besides, the shore lay no\\nmore than two miles off, and it would be child’s play for the Canadian\\nto guide that nimble skiff through those rows of reefs so ill-fated\\nfor big ships.\\n\\nThe next day, January 5, after its deck paneling was opened, the skiff\\nwas wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from the top of the\\nplatform. Two men were sufficient for this operation. The oars were\\ninside the longboat and we had only to take our seats.\\n\\nAt eight o’clock, armed with rifles and axes, we pulled clear of the\\nNautilus. The sea was fairly calm. A mild breeze blew from shore. In\\nplace by the oars, Conseil and I rowed vigorously, and Ned steered us\\ninto the narrow lanes between the breakers. The skiff handled easily\\nand sped swiftly.\\n\\nNed Land couldn’t conceal his glee. He was a prisoner escaping from\\nprison and never dreaming he would need to reenter it.\\n\\n“Meat!” he kept repeating. “Now we’ll eat red meat! Actual game! A\\nreal mess call, by thunder! I’m not saying fish aren’t good for you,\\nbut we mustn’t overdo ‘em, and a slice of fresh venison grilled over\\nlive coals will be a nice change from our standard fare.”\\n\\n“You glutton,” Conseil replied, “you’re making my mouth water!”\\n\\n“It remains to be seen,” I said, “whether these forests do contain\\ngame, and if the types of game aren’t of such size that they can hunt\\nthe hunter.”\\n\\n“Fine, Professor Aronnax!” replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed to\\nbe as honed as the edge of an ax. “But if there’s no other quadruped\\non this island, I’ll eat tiger—tiger sirloin.”\\n\\n“Our friend Ned grows disturbing,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Whatever it is,” Ned Land went on, “any animal having four feet\\nwithout feathers, or two feet with feathers, will be greeted by my\\nvery own one-gun salute.”\\n\\n“Oh good!” I replied. “The reckless Mr. Land is at it again!”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, Professor Aronnax, just keep rowing!” the Canadian\\nreplied. “I only need twenty-five minutes to serve you one of my own\\nspecial creations.”\\n\\nBy 8:30 the Nautilus’s skiff had just run gently aground on a sandy\\nstrand, after successfully clearing the ring of coral that surrounds\\nGueboroa Island.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\nSome Days Ashore\\n\\n\\nSTEPPING ASHORE had an exhilarating effect on me. Ned Land tested the\\nsoil with his foot, as if he were laying claim to it. Yet it had been\\nonly two months since we had become, as Captain Nemo expressed it,\\n“passengers on the Nautilus,” in other words, the literal prisoners of\\nits commander.\\n\\nIn a few minutes we were a gunshot away from the coast. The soil was\\nalmost entirely madreporic, but certain dry stream beds were strewn\\nwith granite rubble, proving that this island was of primordial\\norigin. The entire horizon was hidden behind a curtain of wonderful\\nforests. Enormous trees, sometimes as high as 200 feet, were linked to\\neach other by garlands of tropical creepers, genuine natural hammocks\\nthat swayed in a mild breeze. There were mimosas, banyan trees,\\nbeefwood, teakwood, hibiscus, screw pines, palm trees, all mingling in\\nwild profusion; and beneath the shade of their green canopies, at the\\nfeet of their gigantic trunks, there grew orchids, leguminous plants,\\nand ferns.\\n\\nMeanwhile, ignoring all these fine specimens of Papuan flora, the\\nCanadian passed up the decorative in favor of the functional. He\\nspotted a coconut palm, beat down some of its fruit, broke them open,\\nand we drank their milk and ate their meat with a pleasure that was a\\nprotest against our standard fare on the Nautilus.\\n\\n“Excellent!” Ned Land said.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Exquisite!” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“And I don’t think,” the Canadian said, “that your Nemo would object\\nto us stashing a cargo of coconuts aboard his vessel?”\\n\\n“I imagine not,” I replied, “but he won’t want to sample them.”\\n\\n“Too bad for him!” Conseil said.\\n\\n“And plenty good for us!” Ned Land shot back. “There’ll be more left\\nover!”\\n\\n“A word of caution, Mr. Land,” I told the harpooner, who was about to\\nravage another coconut palm. “Coconuts are admirable things, but\\nbefore we stuff the skiff with them, it would be wise to find out\\nwhether this island offers other substances just as useful. Some fresh\\nvegetables would be well received in the Nautilus’s pantry.”\\n\\n“Master is right,” Conseil replied, “and I propose that we set aside\\nthree places in our longboat: one for fruit, another for vegetables,\\nand a third for venison, of which I still haven’t glimpsed the tiniest\\nspecimen.”\\n\\n“Don’t give up so easily, Conseil,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“So let’s continue our excursion,” I went on, “but keep a sharp\\nlookout. This island seems uninhabited, but it still might harbor\\ncertain individuals who aren’t so finicky about the sort of game they\\neat!”\\n\\n“Hee hee!” Ned put in, with a meaningful movement of his jaws.\\n\\n“Ned! Oh horrors!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Ye gods,” the Canadian shot back, “I’m starting to appreciate the\\ncharms of cannibalism!”\\n\\n“Ned, Ned! Don’t say that!” Conseil answered. “You a cannibal? Why,\\nI’ll no longer be safe next to you, I who share your cabin! Does this\\nmean I’ll wake up half devoured one fine day?”\\n\\n“I’m awfully fond of you, Conseil my friend, but not enough to eat you\\nwhen there’s better food around.”\\n\\n“Then I daren’t delay,” Conseil replied. “The hunt is on! We\\nabsolutely must bag some game to placate this man-eater, or one of\\nthese mornings master won’t find enough pieces of his manservant to\\nserve him.”\\n\\nWhile exchanging this chitchat, we entered beneath the dark canopies\\nof the forest, and for two hours we explored it in every direction.\\n\\nWe couldn’t have been luckier in our search for edible vegetation, and\\nsome of the most useful produce in the tropical zones supplied us with\\na valuable foodstuff missing on board.\\n\\nI mean the breadfruit tree, which is quite abundant on Gueboroa\\nIsland, and there I chiefly noted the seedless variety that in\\nMalaysia is called “rima.”\\n\\nThis tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty\\nfeet high. To the naturalist’s eye, its gracefully rounded crown,\\nformed of big multilobed leaves, was enough to denote the artocarpus\\nthat has been so successfully transplanted to the Mascarene Islands\\neast of\\n\\nMadagascar. From its mass of greenery, huge globular fruit stood out,\\na decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that\\nassumed a hexangular pattern. It’s a handy plant that nature gives to\\nregions lacking in wheat; without needing to be cultivated, it bears\\nfruit eight months out of the year.\\n\\nNed Land was on familiar terms with this fruit. He had already eaten\\nit on his many voyages and knew how to cook its edible substance. So\\nthe very sight of it aroused his appetite, and he couldn’t control\\nhimself.\\n\\n“Sir,” he told me, “I’ll die if I don’t sample a little breadfruit\\npasta!”\\n\\n“Sample some, Ned my friend, sample all you like. We’re here to\\nconduct experiments, let’s conduct them.”\\n\\n“It won’t take a minute,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\nEquipped with a magnifying glass, he lit a fire of deadwood that was\\nsoon crackling merrily. Meanwhile Conseil and I selected the finest\\nartocarpus fruit. Some still weren’t ripe enough, and their thick\\nskins covered white, slightly fibrous pulps. But a great many others\\nwere yellowish and gelatinous, just begging to be picked.\\n\\nThis fruit contained no pits. Conseil brought a dozen of them to Ned\\nLand, who cut them into thick slices and placed them over a fire of\\nlive coals, all the while repeating:\\n\\n“You’ll see, sir, how tasty this bread is!”\\n\\n“Especially since we’ve gone without baked goods for so long,” Conseil\\nsaid.\\n\\n“It’s more than just bread,” the Canadian added. “It’s a dainty\\npastry. You’ve never eaten any, sir?”\\n\\n“No, Ned.”\\n\\n“All right, get ready for something downright delectable! If you don’t\\ncome back for seconds, I’m no longer the King of Harpooners!”\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, the parts of the fruit exposed to the fire were\\ncompletely toasted. On the inside there appeared some white pasta, a\\nsort of soft bread center whose flavor reminded me of artichoke.\\n\\nThis bread was excellent, I must admit, and I ate it with great\\npleasure.\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” I said, “this pasta won’t stay fresh, so it seems\\npointless to make a supply for on board.”\\n\\n“By thunder, sir!” Ned Land exclaimed. “There you go, talking like a\\nnaturalist, but meantime I’ll be acting like a baker! Conseil, harvest\\nsome of this fruit to take with us when we go back.”\\n\\n“And how will you prepare it?” I asked the Canadian.\\n\\n“I’ll make a fermented batter from its pulp that’ll keep indefinitely\\nwithout spoiling. When I want some, I’ll just cook it in the galley on\\nboard—it’ll have a slightly tart flavor, but you’ll find it\\nexcellent.”\\n\\n“So, Mr. Ned, I see that this bread is all we need—”\\n\\n“Not quite, professor,” the Canadian replied. “We need some fruit to\\ngo with it, or at least some vegetables.”\\n\\n“Then let’s look for fruit and vegetables.”\\n\\nWhen our breadfruit harvesting was done, we took to the trail to\\ncomplete this “dry-land dinner.”\\n\\nWe didn’t search in vain, and near noontime we had an ample supply of\\nbananas. This delicious produce from the Torrid Zones ripens all year\\nround, and Malaysians, who give them the name “pisang,” eat them\\nwithout bothering to cook them. In addition to bananas, we gathered\\nsome enormous jackfruit with a very tangy flavor, some tasty mangoes,\\nand some pineapples of unbelievable size. But this foraging took up a\\ngood deal of our time, which, even so, we had no cause to regret.\\n\\nConseil kept Ned under observation. The harpooner walked in the lead,\\nand during his stroll through this forest, he gathered with sure hands\\nsome excellent fruit that should have completed his provisions.\\n\\n“So,” Conseil asked, “you have everything you need, Ned my friend?”\\n\\n“Humph!” the Canadian put in.\\n\\n“What! You’re complaining?”\\n\\n“All this vegetation doesn’t make a meal,” Ned replied. “Just side\\ndishes, dessert. But where’s the soup course? Where’s the roast?”\\n\\n“Right,” I said. “Ned promised us cutlets, which seems highly\\nquestionable to me.”\\n\\n“Sir,” the Canadian replied, “our hunting not only isn’t over, it\\nhasn’t even started. Patience! We’re sure to end up bumping into some\\nanimal with either feathers or fur, if not in this locality, then in\\nanother.”\\n\\n“And if not today, then tomorrow, because we mustn’t wander too far\\noff,” Conseil added. “That’s why I propose that we return to the\\nskiff.”\\n\\n“What! Already!” Ned exclaimed.\\n\\n“We ought to be back before nightfall,” I said.\\n\\n“But what hour is it, then?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Two o’clock at least,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“How time flies on solid ground!” exclaimed Mr. Ned Land with a sigh\\nof regret.\\n\\n“Off we go!” Conseil replied.\\n\\nSo we returned through the forest, and we completed our harvest by\\nmaking a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked from\\nthe crowns of their trees, some small beans that I recognized as the\\n“abrou” of the Malaysians, and some high-quality yams.\\n\\nWe were overloaded when we arrived at the skiff. However, Ned Land\\nstill found these provisions inadequate. But fortune smiled on\\nhim. Just as we were boarding, he spotted several trees twenty-five to\\nthirty feet high, belonging to the palm species. As valuable as the\\nartocarpus, these trees are justly ranked among the most useful\\nproduce in Malaysia.\\n\\nThey were sago palms, vegetation that grows without being cultivated;\\nlike mulberry trees, they reproduce by means of shoots and seeds.\\n\\nNed Land knew how to handle these trees. Taking his ax and wielding it\\nwith great vigor, he soon stretched out on the ground two or three\\nsago palms, whose maturity was revealed by the white dust sprinkled\\nover their palm fronds.\\n\\nI watched him more as a naturalist than as a man in hunger. He began\\nby removing from each trunk an inch-thick strip of bark that covered a\\nnetwork of long, hopelessly tangled fibers that were puttied with a\\nsort of gummy flour. This flour was the starch-like sago, an edible\\nsubstance chiefly consumed by the Melanesian peoples.\\n\\nFor the time being, Ned Land was content to chop these trunks into\\npieces, as if he were making firewood; later he would extract the\\nflour by sifting it through cloth to separate it from its fibrous\\nligaments, let it dry out in the sun, and leave it to harden inside\\nmolds.\\n\\nFinally, at five o’clock in the afternoon, laden with all our\\ntreasures, we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled\\nalongside the Nautilus. Nobody appeared on our arrival. The enormous\\nsheet-iron cylinder seemed deserted. Our provisions loaded on board, I\\nwent below to my stateroom. There I found my supper ready. I ate and\\nthen fell asleep.\\n\\nThe next day, January 6: nothing new on board. Not a sound inside, not\\na sign of life. The skiff stayed alongside in the same place we had\\nleft it. We decided to return to Gueboroa Island. Ned Land hoped for\\nbetter luck in his hunting than on the day before, and he wanted to\\nvisit a different part of the forest.\\n\\nBy sunrise we were off. Carried by an inbound current, the longboat\\nreached the island in a matter of moments.\\n\\nWe disembarked, and thinking it best to abide by the Canadian’s\\ninstincts, we followed Ned Land, whose long legs threatened to outpace\\nus.\\n\\nNed Land went westward up the coast; then, fording some stream beds,\\nhe reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests. Some\\nkingfishers lurked along the watercourses, but they didn’t let us\\napproach. Their cautious behavior proved to me that these winged\\ncreatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species, and I\\nconcluded that if this island wasn’t inhabited, at least human beings\\npaid it frequent visits.\\n\\nAfter crossing a pretty lush prairie, we arrived on the outskirts of a\\nsmall wood, enlivened by the singing and soaring of a large number of\\nbirds.\\n\\n“Still, they’re merely birds,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“But some are edible,” the harpooner replied.\\n\\n“Wrong, Ned my friend,” Conseil answered, “because I see only ordinary\\nparrots here.”\\n\\n“Conseil my friend,” Ned replied in all seriousness, “parrots are like\\npheasant to people with nothing else on their plates.”\\n\\n“And I might add,” I said, “that when these birds are properly cooked,\\nthey’re at least worth a stab of the fork.”\\n\\nIndeed, under the dense foliage of this wood, a whole host of parrots\\nfluttered from branch to branch, needing only the proper upbringing to\\nspeak human dialects. At present they were cackling in chorus with\\nparakeets of every color, with solemn cockatoos that seemed to be\\npondering some philosophical problem, while bright red lories passed\\nby like pieces of bunting borne on the breeze, in the midst of kalao\\nparrots raucously on the wing, Papuan lories painted the subtlest\\nshades of azure, and a whole variety of delightful winged creatures,\\nnone terribly edible.\\n\\nHowever, one bird unique to these shores, which never passes beyond\\nthe boundaries of the Aru and Papuan Islands, was missing from this\\ncollection. But I was given a chance to marvel at it soon enough.\\n\\nAfter crossing through a moderately dense thicket, we again found some\\nplains obstructed by bushes. There I saw some magnificent birds\\nsoaring aloft, the arrangement of their long feathers causing them to\\nhead into the wind. Their undulating flight, the grace of their aerial\\ncurves, and the play of their colors allured and delighted the eye. I\\nhad no trouble identifying them.\\n\\n“Birds of paradise!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Order Passeriforma, division Clystomora,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Partridge family?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“I doubt it, Mr. Land. Nevertheless, I’m counting on your dexterity to\\ncatch me one of these delightful representatives of tropical nature!”\\n\\n“I’ll give it a try, professor, though I’m handier with a harpoon than\\na rifle.”\\n\\nMalaysians, who do a booming business in these birds with the Chinese,\\nhave various methods for catching them that we couldn’t use. Sometimes\\nthey set snares on the tops of the tall trees that the bird of\\nparadise prefers to inhabit. At other times they capture it with a\\ntenacious glue that paralyzes its movements. They will even go so far\\nas to poison the springs where these fowl habitually drink. But in our\\ncase, all we could do was fire at them on the wing, which left us\\nlittle chance of getting one. And in truth, we used up a good part of\\nour ammunition in vain.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the morning, we cleared the lower slopes of the\\nmountains that form the island’s center, and we still hadn’t bagged a\\nthing. Hunger spurred us on. The hunters had counted on consuming the\\nproceeds of their hunting, and they had miscalculated. Luckily, and\\nmuch to his surprise, Conseil pulled off a right-and-left shot and\\ninsured our breakfast. He brought down a white pigeon and a ringdove,\\nwhich were briskly plucked, hung from a spit, and roasted over a\\nblazing fire of deadwood. While these fascinating animals were\\ncooking, Ned prepared some bread from the artocarpus. Then the pigeon\\nand ringdove were devoured to the bones and declared\\nexcellent. Nutmeg, on which these birds habitually gorge themselves,\\nsweetens their flesh and makes it delicious eating.\\n\\n“They taste like chicken stuffed with truffles,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“All right, Ned,” I asked the Canadian, “now what do you need?”\\n\\n“Game with four paws, Professor Aronnax,” Ned Land replied. “All these\\npigeons are only appetizers, snacks. So till I’ve bagged an animal\\nwith cutlets, I won’t be happy!”\\n\\n“Nor I, Ned, until I’ve caught a bird of paradise.”\\n\\n“Then let’s keep hunting,” Conseil replied, “but while heading back to\\nthe sea. We’ve arrived at the foothills of these mountains, and I\\nthink we’ll do better if we return to the forest regions.”\\n\\nIt was good advice and we took it. After an hour’s walk we reached a\\ngenuine sago palm forest. A few harmless snakes fled underfoot. Birds\\nof paradise stole off at our approach, and I was in real despair of\\ncatching one when Conseil, walking in the lead, stooped suddenly, gave\\na triumphant shout, and came back to me, carrying a magnificent bird\\nof paradise.\\n\\n“Oh bravo, Conseil!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Master is too kind,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Not at all, my boy. That was a stroke of genius, catching one of\\nthese live birds with your bare hands!”\\n\\n“If master will examine it closely, he’ll see that I deserve no great\\npraise.”\\n\\n“And why not, Conseil?”\\n\\n“Because this bird is as drunk as a lord.”\\n\\n“Drunk?”\\n\\n“Yes, master, drunk from the nutmegs it was devouring under that\\nnutmeg tree where I caught it. See, Ned my friend, see the monstrous\\nresults of intemperance!”\\n\\n“Damnation!” the Canadian shot back. “Considering the amount of gin\\nI’ve had these past two months, you’ve got nothing to complain about!”\\n\\nMeanwhile I was examining this unusual bird. Conseil was not\\nmistaken. Tipsy from that potent juice, our bird of paradise had been\\nreduced to helplessness. It was unable to fly. It was barely able to\\nwalk. But this didn’t alarm me, and I just let it sleep off its\\nnutmeg.\\n\\nThis bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited to\\nPapua and its neighboring islands. It was a “great emerald,” one of\\nthe rarest birds of paradise. It measured three decimeters long. Its\\nhead was comparatively small, and its eyes, placed near the opening of\\nits beak, were also small. But it offered a wonderful mixture of hues:\\na yellow beak, brown feet and claws, hazel wings with purple tips,\\npale yellow head and scruff of the neck, emerald throat, the belly and\\nchest maroon to brown. Two strands, made of a horn substance covered\\nwith down, rose over its tail, which was lengthened by long, very\\nlight feathers of wonderful fineness, and they completed the costume\\nof this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically named “the\\nsun bird.”\\n\\nHow I wished I could take this superb bird of paradise back to Paris,\\nto make a gift of it to the zoo at the Botanical Gardens, which\\ndoesn’t own a single live specimen.\\n\\n“So it must be a rarity or something?” the Canadian asked, in the tone\\nof a hunter who, from the viewpoint of his art, gives the game a\\npretty low rating.\\n\\n“A great rarity, my gallant comrade, and above all very hard to\\ncapture alive. And even after they’re dead, there’s still a major\\nmarket for these birds. So the natives have figured out how to create\\nfake ones, like people create fake pearls or diamonds.”\\n\\n“What!” Conseil exclaimed. “They make counterfeit birds of paradise?”\\n\\n“Yes, Conseil.”\\n\\n“And is master familiar with how the islanders go about it?”\\n\\n“Perfectly familiar. During the easterly monsoon season, birds of\\nparadise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails that\\nnaturalists call ‘below-the-wing’ feathers. These feathers are\\ngathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor\\npreviously mutilated parakeet. Then they paint over the suture,\\nvarnish the bird, and ship the fruits of their unique labors to\\nmuseums and collectors in Europe.”\\n\\n“Good enough!” Ned Land put in. “If it isn’t the right bird, it’s\\nstill the right feathers, and so long as the merchandise isn’t meant\\nto be eaten, I see no great harm!”\\n\\nBut if my desires were fulfilled by the capture of this bird of\\nparadise, those of our Canadian huntsman remained\\nunsatisfied. Luckily, near two o’clock Ned Land brought down a\\nmagnificent wild pig of the type the natives call “bari-outang.” This\\nanimal came in the nick of time for us to bag some real quadruped\\nmeat, and it was warmly welcomed. Ned Land proved himself quite\\ngloriously with his gunshot. Hit by an electric bullet, the pig\\ndropped dead on the spot.\\n\\nThe Canadian properly skinned and cleaned it, after removing half a\\ndozen cutlets destined to serve as the grilled meat course of our\\nevening meal. Then the hunt was on again, and once more would be\\nmarked by the exploits of Ned and Conseil.\\n\\nIn essence, beating the bushes, the two friends flushed a herd of\\nkangaroos that fled by bounding away on their elastic paws. But these\\nanimals didn’t flee so swiftly that our electric capsules couldn’t\\ncatch up with them.\\n\\n“Oh, professor!” shouted Ned Land, whose hunting fever had gone to his\\nbrain. “What excellent game, especially in a stew! What a supply for\\nthe Nautilus! Two, three, five down! And just think how we’ll devour\\nall this meat ourselves, while those numbskulls on board won’t get a\\nshred!”\\n\\nIn his uncontrollable glee, I think the Canadian might have\\nslaughtered the whole horde, if he hadn’t been so busy talking! But he\\nwas content with a dozen of these fascinating marsupials, which make\\nup the first order of aplacental mammals, as Conseil just had to tell\\nus.\\n\\nThese animals were small in stature. They were a species of those\\n“rabbit kangaroos” that usually dwell in the hollows of trees and are\\ntremendously fast; but although of moderate dimensions, they at least\\nfurnish a meat that’s highly prized.\\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with the results of our hunting. A\\ngleeful Ned proposed that we return the next day to this magic island,\\nwhich he planned to depopulate of its every edible quadruped. But he\\nwas reckoning without events.\\n\\nBy six o’clock in the evening, we were back on the beach. The skiff\\nwas aground in its usual place. The Nautilus, looking like a long\\nreef, emerged from the waves two miles offshore.\\n\\nWithout further ado, Ned Land got down to the important business of\\ndinner. He came wonderfully to terms with its entire cooking. Grilling\\nover the coals, those cutlets from the “bari-outang” soon gave off a\\nsucculent aroma that perfumed the air.\\n\\nBut I catch myself following in the Canadian’s footsteps. Look at\\nme—in ecstasy over freshly grilled pork! Please grant me a pardon as\\nI’ve already granted one to Mr. Land, and on the same grounds!\\n\\nIn short, dinner was excellent. Two ringdoves rounded out this\\nextraordinary menu. Sago pasta, bread from the artocarpus, mangoes,\\nhalf a dozen pineapples, and the fermented liquor from certain\\ncoconuts heightened our glee. I suspect that my two fine companions\\nweren’t quite as clearheaded as one could wish.\\n\\n“What if we don’t return to the Nautilus this evening?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“What if we never return to it?” Ned Land added.\\n\\nJust then a stone whizzed toward us, landed at our feet, and cut short\\nthe harpooner’s proposition.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\nThe Lightning Bolts of Captain Nemo\\n\\n\\nWITHOUT STANDING UP, we stared in the direction of the forest, my hand\\nstopping halfway to my mouth, Ned Land’s completing its assignment.\\n\\n“Stones don’t fall from the sky,” Conseil said, “or else they deserve\\nto be called meteorites.”\\n\\nA second well-polished stone removed a tasty ringdove leg from\\nConseil’s hand, giving still greater relevance to his observation.\\n\\nWe all three stood up, rifles to our shoulders, ready to answer any\\nattack.\\n\\n“Apes maybe?” Ned Land exclaimed.\\n\\n“Nearly,” Conseil replied. “Savages.”\\n\\n“Head for the skiff!” I said, moving toward the sea.\\n\\nIndeed, it was essential to beat a retreat because some twenty\\nnatives, armed with bows and slings, appeared barely a hundred paces\\noff, on the outskirts of a thicket that masked the horizon to our\\nright.\\n\\nThe skiff was aground ten fathoms away from us.\\n\\nThe savages approached without running, but they favored us with a\\nshow of the greatest hostility. It was raining stones and arrows.\\n\\nNed Land was unwilling to leave his provisions behind, and despite the\\nimpending danger, he clutched his pig on one side, his kangaroos on\\nthe other, and scampered off with respectable speed.\\n\\nIn two minutes we were on the strand. Loading provisions and weapons\\ninto the skiff, pushing it to sea, and positioning its two oars were\\nthe work of an instant. We hadn’t gone two cable lengths when a\\nhundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up to\\ntheir waists. I looked to see if their appearance might draw some of\\nthe Nautilus’s men onto the platform. But no. Lying well out, that\\nenormous machine still seemed completely deserted.\\n\\nTwenty minutes later we boarded ship. The hatches were open. After\\nmooring the skiff, we reentered the Nautilus’s interior.\\n\\nI went below to the lounge, from which some chords were\\nwafting. Captain Nemo was there, leaning over the organ, deep in a\\nmusical trance.\\n\\n“Captain!” I said to him.\\n\\nHe didn’t hear me.\\n\\n“Captain!” I went on, touching him with my hand.\\n\\nHe trembled, and turning around:\\n\\n“Ah, it’s you, professor!” he said to me. “Well, did you have a happy\\nhunt? Was your herb gathering a success?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain,” I replied, “but unfortunately we’ve brought back a\\nhorde of bipeds whose proximity worries me.”\\n\\n“What sort of bipeds?”\\n\\n“Savages.”\\n\\n“Savages!” Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone. “You set foot on\\none of the shores of this globe, professor, and you’re surprised to\\nfind savages there? Where aren’t there savages? And besides, are they\\nany worse than men elsewhere, these people you call savages?”\\n\\n“But captain—”\\n\\n“Speaking for myself, sir, I’ve encountered them everywhere.”\\n\\n“Well then,” I replied, “if you don’t want to welcome them aboard the\\nNautilus, you’d better take some precautions!”\\n\\n“Easy, professor, no cause for alarm.”\\n\\n“But there are a large number of these natives.”\\n\\n“What’s your count?”\\n\\n“At least a hundred.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, whose fingers took their\\nplaces again on the organ keys, “if every islander in Papua were to\\ngather on that beach, the Nautilus would still have nothing to fear\\nfrom their attacks!”\\n\\nThe captain’s fingers then ran over the instrument’s keyboard, and I\\nnoticed that he touched only its black keys, which gave his melodies a\\nbasically Scottish color. Soon he had forgotten my presence and was\\nlost in a reverie that I no longer tried to dispel.\\n\\nI climbed onto the platform. Night had already fallen, because in this\\nlow latitude the sun sets quickly, without any twilight. I could see\\nGueboroa Island only dimly. But numerous fires had been kindled on the\\nbeach, attesting that the natives had no thoughts of leaving it.\\n\\nFor several hours I was left to myself, sometimes musing on the\\nislanders—but no longer fearing them because the captain’s unflappable\\nconfidence had won me over—and sometimes forgetting them to marvel at\\nthe splendors of this tropical night. My memories took wing toward\\nFrance, in the wake of those zodiacal stars due to twinkle over it in\\na few hours. The moon shone in the midst of the constellations at\\ntheir zenith. I then remembered that this loyal, good-natured\\nsatellite would return to this same place the day after tomorrow, to\\nraise the tide and tear the Nautilus from its coral bed. Near\\nmidnight, seeing that all was quiet over the darkened waves as well as\\nunder the waterside trees, I repaired to my cabin and fell into a\\npeaceful sleep.\\n\\nThe night passed without mishap. No doubt the Papuans had been\\nfrightened off by the mere sight of this monster aground in the bay,\\nbecause our hatches stayed open, offering easy access to the\\nNautilus’s interior.\\n\\nAt six o’clock in the morning, January 8, I climbed onto the\\nplatform. The morning shadows were lifting. The island was soon on\\nview through the dissolving mists, first its beaches, then its\\nsummits.\\n\\nThe islanders were still there, in greater numbers than on the day\\nbefore, perhaps 500 or 600 of them. Taking advantage of the low tide,\\nsome of them had moved forward over the heads of coral to within two\\ncable lengths of the Nautilus. I could easily distinguish them. They\\nobviously were true Papuans, men of fine stock, athletic in build,\\nforehead high and broad, nose large but not flat, teeth white. Their\\nwoolly, red-tinted hair was in sharp contrast to their bodies, which\\nwere black and glistening like those of Nubians. Beneath their\\npierced, distended earlobes there dangled strings of beads made from\\nbone. Generally these savages were naked. I noted some women among\\nthem, dressed from hip to knee in grass skirts held up by belts made\\nof vegetation. Some of the chieftains adorned their necks with\\ncrescents and with necklaces made from beads of red and white\\nglass. Armed with bows, arrows, and shields, nearly all of them\\ncarried from their shoulders a sort of net, which held those polished\\nstones their slings hurl with such dexterity.\\n\\nOne of these chieftains came fairly close to the Nautilus, examining\\nit with care. He must have been a “mado” of high rank, because he\\nparaded in a mat of banana leaves that had ragged edges and was\\naccented with bright colors.\\n\\nI could easily have picked off this islander, he stood at such close\\nrange; but I thought it best to wait for an actual show of\\nhostility. Between Europeans and savages, it’s acceptable for\\nEuropeans to shoot back but not to attack first.\\n\\nDuring this whole time of low tide, the islanders lurked near the\\nNautilus, but they weren’t boisterous. I often heard them repeat the\\nword “assai,” and from their gestures I understood they were inviting\\nme to go ashore, an invitation I felt obliged to decline.\\n\\nSo the skiff didn’t leave shipside that day, much to the displeasure\\nof Mr. Land who couldn’t complete his provisions. The adroit Canadian\\nspent his time preparing the meat and flour products he had brought\\nfrom Gueboroa Island. As for the savages, they went back to shore near\\neleven o’clock in the morning, when the heads of coral began to\\ndisappear under the waves of the rising tide. But I saw their numbers\\nswell considerably on the beach. It was likely that they had come from\\nneighboring islands or from the mainland of Papua proper. However, I\\ndidn’t see one local dugout canoe.\\n\\nHaving nothing better to do, I decided to dredge these beautiful,\\nclear waters, which exhibited a profusion of shells, zoophytes, and\\nopen-sea plants. Besides, it was the last day the Nautilus would spend\\nin these waterways, if, tomorrow, it still floated off to the open sea\\nas Captain Nemo had promised.\\n\\nSo I summoned Conseil, who brought me a small, light dragnet similar\\nto those used in oyster fishing.\\n\\n“What about these savages?” Conseil asked me. “With all due respect to\\nmaster, they don’t strike me as very wicked!”\\n\\n“They’re cannibals even so, my boy.”\\n\\n“A person can be both a cannibal and a decent man,” Conseil replied,\\n“just as a person can be both gluttonous and honorable. The one\\ndoesn’t exclude the other.”\\n\\n“Fine, Conseil! And I agree that there are honorable cannibals who\\ndecently devour their prisoners. However, I’m opposed to being\\ndevoured, even in all decency, so I’ll keep on my guard, especially\\nsince the Nautilus’s commander seems to be taking no precautions. And\\nnow let’s get to work!”\\n\\nFor two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without bringing\\nup any rarities. Our dragnet was filled with Midas abalone, harp\\nshells, obelisk snails, and especially the finest hammer shells I had\\nseen to that day. We also gathered in a few sea cucumbers, some pearl\\noysters, and a dozen small turtles that we saved for the ship’s\\npantry.\\n\\nBut just when I least expected it, I laid my hands on a wonder, a\\nnatural deformity I’d have to call it, something very seldom\\nencountered. Conseil had just made a cast of the dragnet, and his gear\\nhad come back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells,\\nwhen suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net, pull out\\na shelled animal, and give a conchological yell, in other words, the\\nmost piercing yell a human throat can produce.\\n\\n“Eh? What happened to master?” Conseil asked, very startled. “Did\\nmaster get bitten?”\\n\\n“No, my boy, but I’d gladly have sacrificed a finger for such a find!”\\n\\n“What find?”\\n\\n“This shell,” I said, displaying the subject of my triumph.\\n\\n“But that’s simply an olive shell of the ‘tent olive’ species, genus\\nOliva, order Pectinibranchia, class Gastropoda, branch Mollusca—”\\n\\n“Yes, yes, Conseil! But instead of coiling from right to left, this\\nolive shell rolls from left to right!”\\n\\n“It can’t be!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy, it’s a left-handed shell!”\\n\\n“A left-handed shell!” Conseil repeated, his heart pounding.\\n\\n“Look at its spiral!”\\n\\n“Oh, master can trust me on this,” Conseil said, taking the valuable\\nshell in trembling hands, “but never have I felt such excitement!”\\n\\nAnd there was good reason to be excited! In fact, as naturalists have\\nventured to observe, “dextrality” is a well-known law of nature. In\\ntheir rotational and orbital movements, stars and their satellites go\\nfrom right to left. Man uses his right hand more often than his left,\\nand consequently his various instruments and equipment (staircases,\\nlocks, watch springs, etc.) are designed to be used in a right-to-left\\nmanner. Now then, nature has generally obeyed this law in coiling her\\nshells. They’re right-handed with only rare exceptions, and when by\\nchance a shell’s spiral is left-handed, collectors will pay its weight\\nin gold for it.\\n\\nSo Conseil and I were deep in the contemplation of our treasure, and I\\nwas solemnly promising myself to enrich the Paris Museum with it, when\\nan ill-timed stone, hurled by one of the islanders, whizzed over and\\nshattered the valuable object in Conseil’s hands.\\n\\nI gave a yell of despair! Conseil pounced on his rifle and aimed at a\\nsavage swinging a sling just ten meters away from him. I tried to stop\\nhim, but his shot went off and shattered a bracelet of amulets\\ndangling from the islander’s arm.\\n\\n“Conseil!” I shouted. “Conseil!”\\n\\n“Eh? What? Didn’t master see that this man-eater initiated the\\nattack?”\\n\\n“A shell isn’t worth a human life!” I told him.\\n\\n“Oh, the rascal!” Conseil exclaimed. “I’d rather he cracked my\\nshoulder!”\\n\\nConseil was in dead earnest, but I didn’t subscribe to his\\nviews. However, the situation had changed in only a short time and we\\nhadn’t noticed. Now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding the\\nNautilus. Hollowed from tree trunks, these dugouts were long, narrow,\\nand well designed for speed, keeping their balance by means of two\\nbamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water. They were\\nmaneuvered by skillful, half-naked paddlers, and I viewed their\\nadvance with definite alarm.\\n\\nIt was obvious these Papuans had already entered into relations with\\nEuropeans and knew their ships. But this long, iron cylinder lying in\\nthe bay, with no masts or funnels—what were they to make of it?\\nNothing good, because at first they kept it at a respectful\\ndistance. However, seeing that it stayed motionless, they regained\\nconfidence little by little and tried to become more familiar with\\nit. Now then, it was precisely this familiarity that we needed to\\nprevent. Since our weapons made no sound when they went off, they\\nwould have only a moderate effect on these islanders, who reputedly\\nrespect nothing but noisy mechanisms. Without thunderclaps, lightning\\nbolts would be much less frightening, although the danger lies in the\\nflash, not the noise.\\n\\nJust then the dugout canoes drew nearer to the Nautilus, and a cloud\\nof arrows burst over us.\\n\\n“Fire and brimstone, it’s hailing!” Conseil said. “And poisoned hail\\nperhaps!”\\n\\n“We’ve got to alert Captain Nemo,” I said, reentering the hatch.\\n\\nI went below to the lounge. I found no one there. I ventured a knock\\nat the door opening into the captain’s stateroom.\\n\\nThe word “Enter!” answered me. I did so and found Captain Nemo busy\\nwith calculations in which there was no shortage of X and other\\nalgebraic signs.\\n\\n“Am I disturbing you?” I said out of politeness.\\n\\n“Correct, Professor Aronnax,” the captain answered me. “But I imagine\\nyou have pressing reasons for looking me up?”\\n\\n“Very pressing. Native dugout canoes are surrounding us, and in a few\\nminutes we’re sure to be assaulted by several hundred savages.”\\n\\n“Ah!” Captain Nemo put in serenely. “They’ve come in their dugouts?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, closing the hatches should do the trick.”\\n\\n“Precisely, and that’s what I came to tell you—”\\n\\n“Nothing easier,” Captain Nemo said.\\n\\nAnd he pressed an electric button, transmitting an order to the crew’s\\nquarters.\\n\\n“There, sir, all under control!” he told me after a few moments. “The\\nskiff is in place and the hatches are closed. I don’t imagine you’re\\nworried that these gentlemen will stave in walls that shells from your\\nfrigate couldn’t breach?”\\n\\n“No, captain, but one danger still remains.”\\n\\n“What’s that, sir?”\\n\\n“Tomorrow at about this time, we’ll need to reopen the hatches to\\nrenew the Nautilus’s air.”\\n\\n“No argument, sir, since our craft breathes in the manner favored by\\ncetaceans.”\\n\\n“But if these Papuans are occupying the platform at that moment, I\\ndon’t see how you can prevent them from entering.”\\n\\n“Then, sir, you assume they’ll board the ship?”\\n\\n“I’m certain of it.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, let them come aboard. I see no reason to prevent\\nthem. Deep down they’re just poor devils, these Papuans, and I don’t\\nwant my visit to Gueboroa Island to cost the life of a single one of\\nthese unfortunate people!”\\n\\nOn this note I was about to withdraw; but Captain Nemo detained me and\\ninvited me to take a seat next to him. He questioned me with interest\\non our excursions ashore and on our hunting, but seemed not to\\nunderstand the Canadian’s passionate craving for red meat. Then our\\nconversation skimmed various subjects, and without being more\\nforthcoming, Captain Nemo proved more affable.\\n\\nAmong other things, we came to talk of the Nautilus’s circumstances,\\naground in the same strait where Captain Dumont d’Urville had nearly\\nmiscarried. Then, pertinent to this:\\n\\n“He was one of your great seamen,” the captain told me, “one of your\\nshrewdest navigators, that d’Urville! He was the Frenchman’s Captain\\nCook. A man wise but unlucky! Braving the ice banks of the South Pole,\\nthe coral of Oceania, the cannibals of the Pacific, only to perish\\nwretchedly in a train wreck! If that energetic man was able to think\\nabout his life in its last seconds, imagine what his final thoughts\\nmust have been!”\\n\\nAs he spoke, Captain Nemo seemed deeply moved, an emotion I felt was\\nto his credit.\\n\\nThen, chart in hand, we returned to the deeds of the French navigator:\\nhis voyages to circumnavigate the globe, his double attempt at the\\nSouth Pole, which led to his discovery of the Adélie Coast and the\\nLouis-Philippe Peninsula, finally his hydrographic surveys of the\\nchief islands in Oceania.\\n\\n“What your d’Urville did on the surface of the sea,” Captain Nemo told\\nme, “I’ve done in the ocean’s interior, but more easily, more\\ncompletely than he. Constantly tossed about by hurricanes, the Zealous\\nand the new Astrolabe couldn’t compare with the Nautilus, a quiet work\\nroom truly at rest in the midst of the waters!”\\n\\n“Even so, captain,” I said, “there is one major similarity between\\nDumont d’Urville’s sloops of war and the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“What’s that, sir?”\\n\\n“Like them, the Nautilus has run aground!”\\n\\n“The Nautilus is not aground, sir,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “The\\nNautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor, and I don’t need to\\nundertake the arduous labors, the maneuvers d’Urville had to attempt\\nin order to float off his sloops of war. The Zealous and the new\\nAstrolabe wellnigh perished, but my Nautilus is in no\\ndanger. Tomorrow, on the day stated and at the hour stated, the tide\\nwill peacefully lift it off, and it will resume its navigating through\\nthe seas.”\\n\\n“Captain,” I said, “I don’t doubt—”\\n\\n“Tomorrow,” Captain Nemo added, standing up, “tomorrow at 2:40 in the\\nafternoon, the Nautilus will float off and exit the Torres Strait\\nundamaged.”\\n\\nPronouncing these words in an extremely sharp tone, Captain Nemo gave\\nme a curt bow. This was my dismissal, and I reentered my stateroom.\\n\\nThere I found Conseil, who wanted to know the upshot of my interview\\nwith the captain.\\n\\n“My boy,” I replied, “when I expressed the belief that these Papuan\\nnatives were a threat to his Nautilus, the captain answered me with\\ngreat irony. So I’ve just one thing to say to you: have faith in him\\nand sleep in peace.”\\n\\n“Master has no need for my services?”\\n\\n“No, my friend. What’s Ned Land up to?”\\n\\n“Begging master’s indulgence,” Conseil replied, “but our friend Ned is\\nconcocting a kangaroo pie that will be the eighth wonder!”\\n\\nI was left to myself; I went to bed but slept pretty poorly. I kept\\nhearing noises from the savages, who were stamping on the platform and\\nletting out deafening yells. The night passed in this way, without the\\ncrew ever emerging from their usual inertia. They were no more\\ndisturbed by the presence of these man-eaters than soldiers in an\\narmored fortress are troubled by ants running over the armor plate.\\n\\nI got up at six o’clock in the morning. The hatches weren’t open. So\\nthe air inside hadn’t been renewed; but the air tanks were kept full\\nfor any eventuality and would function appropriately to shoot a few\\ncubic meters of oxygen into the Nautilus’s thin atmosphere.\\n\\nI worked in my stateroom until noon without seeing Captain Nemo even\\nfor an instant. Nobody on board seemed to be making any preparations\\nfor departure.\\n\\nI still waited for a while, then I made my way to the main lounge. Its\\ntimepiece marked 2:30. In ten minutes the tide would reach its maximum\\nelevation, and if Captain Nemo hadn’t made a rash promise, the\\nNautilus would immediately break free. If not, many months might pass\\nbefore it could leave its coral bed.\\n\\nBut some preliminary vibrations could soon be felt over the boat’s\\nhull. I heard its plating grind against the limestone roughness of\\nthat coral base.\\n\\nAt 2:35 Captain Nemo appeared in the lounge.\\n\\n“We’re about to depart,” he said.\\n\\n“Ah!” I put in.\\n\\n“I’ve given orders to open the hatches.”\\n\\n“What about the Papuans?”\\n\\n“What about them?” Captain Nemo replied, with a light shrug of his\\nshoulders.\\n\\n“Won’t they come inside the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“How will they manage that?”\\n\\n“By jumping down the hatches you’re about to open.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo replied serenely, “the Nautilus’s\\nhatches aren’t to be entered in that fashion even when they’re open.”\\n\\nI gaped at the captain.\\n\\n“You don’t understand?” he said to me.\\n\\n“Not in the least.”\\n\\n“Well, come along and you’ll see!”\\n\\nI headed to the central companionway. There, very puzzled, Ned Land\\nand Conseil watched the crewmen opening the hatches, while a frightful\\nclamor and furious shouts resounded outside.\\n\\nThe hatch lids fell back onto the outer plating. Twenty horrible faces\\nappeared. But when the first islander laid hands on the companionway\\nrailing, he was flung backward by some invisible power, lord knows\\nwhat! He ran off, howling in terror and wildly prancing around.\\n\\nTen of his companions followed him. All ten met the same fate.\\n\\nConseil was in ecstasy. Carried away by his violent instincts, Ned\\nLand leaped up the companionway. But as soon as his hands seized the\\nrailing, he was thrown backward in his turn.\\n\\n“Damnation!” he exclaimed. “I’ve been struck by a lightning bolt!”\\n\\nThese words explained everything to me. It wasn’t just a railing that\\nled to the platform, it was a metal cable fully charged with the\\nship’s electricity. Anyone who touched it got a fearsome shock—and\\nsuch a shock would have been fatal if Captain Nemo had thrown the full\\ncurrent from his equipment into this conducting cable! It could\\nhonestly be said that he had stretched between himself and his\\nassailants a network of electricity no one could clear with impunity.\\n\\nMeanwhile, crazed with terror, the unhinged Papuans beat a retreat. As\\nfor us, half laughing, we massaged and comforted poor Ned Land, who\\nwas swearing like one possessed.\\n\\nBut just then, lifted off by the tide’s final undulations, the\\nNautilus left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed\\nby the captain. Its propeller churned the waves with lazy\\nmajesty. Gathering speed little by little, the ship navigated on the\\nsurface of the ocean, and safe and sound, it left behind the dangerous\\nnarrows of the Torres Strait.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\n“Aegri Somnia”*\\n\\n\\n*Latin: “troubled dreams.” Ed.\\n\\nTHE FOLLOWING DAY, January 10, the Nautilus resumed its travels in\\nmidwater but at a remarkable speed that I estimated to be at least\\nthirty-five miles per hour. The propeller was going so fast I could\\nneither follow nor count its revolutions.\\n\\nI thought about how this marvelous electric force not only gave\\nmotion, heat, and light to the Nautilus but even protected it against\\noutside attack, transforming it into a sacred ark no profane hand\\ncould touch without being blasted; my wonderment was boundless, and it\\nwent from the submersible itself to the engineer who had created it.\\n\\nWe were traveling due west and on January 11 we doubled Cape Wessel,\\nlocated in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north, the\\nwestern tip of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Reefs were still numerous but\\nmore widely scattered and were fixed on the chart with the greatest\\naccuracy. The Nautilus easily avoided the Money breakers to port and\\nthe Victoria reefs to starboard, positioned at longitude 130 degrees\\non the tenth parallel, which we went along rigorously.\\n\\nOn January 13, arriving in the Timor Sea, Captain Nemo raised the\\nisland of that name at longitude 122 degrees. This island, whose\\nsurface area measures 1,625 square leagues, is governed by\\nrajahs. These aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles, in\\nother words, descendants with the most exalted origins to which a\\nhuman being can lay claim. Accordingly, their scaly ancestors infest\\nthe island’s rivers and are the subjects of special veneration. They\\nare sheltered, nurtured, flattered, pampered, and offered a ritual\\ndiet of nubile maidens; and woe to the foreigner who lifts a finger\\nagainst these sacred saurians.\\n\\nBut the Nautilus wanted nothing to do with these nasty animals. Timor\\nIsland was visible for barely an instant at noon while the chief\\nofficer determined his position. I also caught only a glimpse of\\nlittle Roti Island, part of this same group, whose women have a\\nwell-established reputation for beauty in the Malaysian marketplace.\\n\\nAfter our position fix, the Nautilus’s latitude bearings were\\nmodulated to the southwest. Our prow pointed to the Indian\\nOcean. Where would Captain Nemo’s fancies take us? Would he head up to\\nthe shores of Asia? Would he pull nearer to the beaches of Europe?\\nUnlikely choices for a man who avoided populated areas! So would he go\\ndown south? Would he double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and\\npush on to the Antarctic pole? Finally, would he return to the seas of\\nthe Pacific, where his Nautilus could navigate freely and easily? Time\\nwould tell.\\n\\nAfter cruising along the Cartier, Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott\\nreefs, the solid element’s last exertions against the liquid element,\\nwe were beyond all sight of shore by January 14. The Nautilus slowed\\ndown in an odd manner, and very unpredictable in its ways, it\\nsometimes swam in the midst of the waters, sometimes drifted on their\\nsurface.\\n\\nDuring this phase of our voyage, Captain Nemo conducted interesting\\nexperiments on the different temperatures in various strata of the\\nsea. Under ordinary conditions, such readings are obtained using some\\npretty complicated instruments whose findings are dubious to say the\\nleast, whether they’re thermometric sounding lines, whose glass often\\nshatters under the water’s pressure, or those devices based on the\\nvarying resistance of metals to electric currents. The results so\\nobtained can’t be adequately double-checked. By contrast, Captain Nemo\\nwould seek the sea’s temperature by going himself into its depths, and\\nwhen he placed his thermometer in contact with the various layers of\\nliquid, he found the sought-for degree immediately and with certainty.\\n\\nAnd so, by loading up its ballast tanks, or by sinking obliquely with\\nits slanting fins, the Nautilus successively reached depths of 3,000,\\n4,000, 5,000, 7,000, 9,000, and 10,000 meters, and the ultimate\\nconclusion from these experiments was that, in all latitudes, the sea\\nhad a permanent temperature of 4.5 degrees centigrade at a depth of\\n1,000 meters.\\n\\nI watched these experiments with the most intense fascination. Captain\\nNemo brought a real passion to them. I often wondered why he took\\nthese observations. Were they for the benefit of his fellow man? It\\nwas unlikely, because sooner or later his work would perish with him\\nin some unknown sea! Unless he intended the results of his experiments\\nfor me. But that meant this strange voyage of mine would come to an\\nend, and no such end was in sight.\\n\\nBe that as it may, Captain Nemo also introduced me to the different\\ndata he had obtained on the relative densities of the water in our\\nglobe’s chief seas. From this news I derived some personal\\nenlightenment having nothing to do with science.\\n\\nIt happened the morning of January 15. The captain, with whom I was\\nstrolling on the platform, asked me if I knew how salt water differs\\nin density from sea to sea. I said no, adding that there was a lack of\\nrigorous scientific observations on this subject.\\n\\n“I’ve taken such observations,” he told me, “and I can vouch for their\\nreliability.”\\n\\n“Fine,” I replied, “but the Nautilus lives in a separate world, and\\nthe secrets of its scientists don’t make their way ashore.”\\n\\n“You’re right, professor,” he told me after a few moments of\\nsilence. “This is a separate world. It’s as alien to the earth as the\\nplanets accompanying our globe around the sun, and we’ll never become\\nfamiliar with the work of scientists on Saturn or Jupiter. But since\\nfate has linked our two lives, I can reveal the results of my\\nobservations to you.”\\n\\n“I’m all attention, captain.”\\n\\n“You’re aware, professor, that salt water is denser than fresh water,\\nbut this density isn’t uniform. In essence, if I represent the density\\nof fresh water by 1.000, then I find 1.028 for the waters of the\\nAtlantic, 1.026 for the waters of the Pacific, 1.030 for the waters of\\nthe Mediterranean—”\\n\\nAha, I thought, so he ventures into the Mediterranean?\\n\\n“—1.018 for the waters of the Ionian Sea, and 1.029 for the waters of\\nthe Adriatic.”\\n\\nAssuredly, the Nautilus didn’t avoid the heavily traveled seas of\\nEurope, and from this insight I concluded that the ship would take us\\nback—perhaps very soon—to more civilized shores. I expected Ned Land\\nto greet this news with unfeigned satisfaction.\\n\\nFor several days our work hours were spent in all sorts of\\nexperiments, on the degree of salinity in waters of different depths,\\nor on their electric properties, coloration, and transparency, and in\\nevery instance Captain Nemo displayed an ingenuity equaled only by his\\ngraciousness toward me. Then I saw no more of him for some days and\\nagain lived on board in seclusion.\\n\\nOn January 16 the Nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few\\nmeters beneath the surface of the water. Its electric equipment had\\nbeen turned off, and the motionless propeller let it ride with the\\nwaves. I assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs,\\nrequired by the engine’s strenuous mechanical action.\\n\\nMy companions and I then witnessed an unusual sight. The panels in the\\nlounge were open, and since the Nautilus’s beacon was off, a hazy\\ndarkness reigned in the midst of the waters. Covered with heavy\\nclouds, the stormy sky gave only the faintest light to the ocean’s\\nupper strata.\\n\\nI was observing the state of the sea under these conditions, and even\\nthe largest fish were nothing more than ill-defined shadows, when the\\nNautilus was suddenly transferred into broad daylight. At first I\\nthought the beacon had gone back on and was casting its electric light\\ninto the liquid mass. I was mistaken, and after a hasty examination I\\ndiscovered my error.\\n\\nThe Nautilus had drifted into the midst of some phosphorescent strata,\\nwhich, in this darkness, came off as positively dazzling. This effect\\nwas caused by myriads of tiny, luminous animals whose brightness\\nincreased when they glided over the metal hull of our submersible. In\\nthe midst of these luminous sheets of water, I then glimpsed flashes\\nof light, like those seen inside a blazing furnace from streams of\\nmolten lead or from masses of metal brought to a white heat—flashes so\\nintense that certain areas of the light became shadows by comparison,\\nin a fiery setting from which every shadow should seemingly have been\\nbanished. No, this was no longer the calm emission of our usual\\nlighting! This light throbbed with unprecedented vigor and activity!\\nYou sensed that it was alive!\\n\\nIn essence, it was a cluster of countless open-sea infusoria, of\\nnoctiluca an eighth of an inch wide, actual globules of transparent\\njelly equipped with a threadlike tentacle, up to 25,000 of which have\\nbeen counted in thirty cubic centimeters of water. And the power of\\ntheir light was increased by those glimmers unique to medusas,\\nstarfish, common jellyfish, angel-wing clams, and other phosphorescent\\nzoophytes, which were saturated with grease from organic matter\\ndecomposed by the sea, and perhaps with mucus secreted by fish.\\n\\nFor several hours the Nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide, and our\\nwonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals cavorting in it, like\\nthe fire-dwelling salamanders of myth. In the midst of these flames\\nthat didn’t burn, I could see swift, elegant porpoises, the tireless\\npranksters of the seas, and sailfish three meters long, those shrewd\\nheralds of hurricanes, whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged\\nagainst the lounge window. Then smaller fish appeared: miscellaneous\\ntriggerfish, leather jacks, unicornfish, and a hundred others that\\nleft stripes on this luminous atmosphere in their course.\\n\\nSome magic lay behind this dazzling sight! Perhaps some atmospheric\\ncondition had intensified this phenomenon? Perhaps a storm had been\\nunleashed on the surface of the waves? But only a few meters down, the\\nNautilus felt no tempest’s fury, and the ship rocked peacefully in the\\nmidst of the calm waters.\\n\\nAnd so it went, some new wonder constantly delighting us. Conseil\\nobserved and classified his zoophytes, articulates, mollusks, and\\nfish. The days passed quickly, and I no longer kept track of\\nthem. Ned, as usual, kept looking for changes of pace from our\\nstandard fare. Like actual snails, we were at home in our shell, and I\\ncan vouch that it’s easy to turn into a full-fledged snail.\\n\\nSo this way of living began to seem simple and natural to us, and we\\nno longer envisioned a different lifestyle on the surface of the\\nplanet earth, when something happened to remind us of our strange\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nOn January 18 the Nautilus lay in longitude 105 degrees and latitude\\n15 degrees south. The weather was threatening, the sea rough and\\nbillowy. The wind was blowing a strong gust from the east. The\\nbarometer, which had been falling for some days, forecast an\\napproaching struggle of the elements.\\n\\nI had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking\\nhis readings of hour angles. Out of habit I waited for him to\\npronounce his daily phrase. But that day it was replaced by a\\ndifferent phrase, just as incomprehensible. Almost at once I saw\\nCaptain Nemo appear, lift his spyglass, and inspect the horizon.\\n\\nFor some minutes the captain stood motionless, rooted to the spot\\ncontained within the field of his lens. Then he lowered his spyglass\\nand exchanged about ten words with his chief officer. The latter\\nseemed to be in the grip of an excitement he tried in vain to\\ncontrol. More in command of himself, Captain Nemo remained\\ncool. Furthermore, he seemed to be raising certain objections that his\\nchief officer kept answering with flat assurances. At least that’s\\nwhat I gathered from their differences in tone and gesture.\\n\\nAs for me, I stared industriously in the direction under observation\\nbut without spotting a thing. Sky and water merged into a perfectly\\nclean horizon line.\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo strolled from one end of the platform to the\\nother, not glancing at me, perhaps not even seeing me. His step was\\nfirm but less regular than usual. Sometimes he would stop, cross his\\narms over his chest, and observe the sea. What could he be looking for\\nover that immense expanse? By then the Nautilus lay hundreds of miles\\nfrom the nearest coast!\\n\\nThe chief officer kept lifting his spyglass and stubbornly examining\\nthe horizon, walking up and down, stamping his foot, in his nervous\\nagitation a sharp contrast to his superior.\\n\\nBut this mystery would inevitably be cleared up, and soon, because\\nCaptain Nemo gave orders to increase speed; at once the engine stepped\\nup its drive power, setting the propeller in swifter rotation.\\n\\nJust then the chief officer drew the captain’s attention anew. The\\nlatter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass at the point\\nindicated. He observed it a good while. As for me, deeply puzzled, I\\nwent below to the lounge and brought back an excellent long-range\\ntelescope I habitually used. Leaning my elbows on the beacon housing,\\nwhich jutted from the stern of the platform, I got set to scour that\\nwhole stretch of sky and sea.\\n\\nBut no sooner had I peered into the eyepiece than the instrument was\\nsnatched from my hands.\\n\\nI spun around. Captain Nemo was standing before me, but I almost\\ndidn’t recognize him. His facial features were transfigured. Gleaming\\nwith dark fire, his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow. His\\nteeth were half bared. His rigid body, clenched fists, and head drawn\\nbetween his shoulders, all attested to a fierce hate breathing from\\nevery pore. He didn’t move. My spyglass fell from his hand and rolled\\nat his feet.\\n\\nHad I accidentally caused these symptoms of anger? Did this\\nincomprehensible individual think I had detected some secret forbidden\\nto guests on the Nautilus?\\n\\nNo! I wasn’t the subject of his hate because he wasn’t even looking at\\nme; his eyes stayed stubbornly focused on that inscrutable point of\\nthe horizon.\\n\\nFinally Captain Nemo regained his self-control. His facial appearance,\\nso profoundly changed, now resumed its usual calm. He addressed a few\\nwords to his chief officer in their strange language, then he turned\\nto me:\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he told me in a tone of some urgency, “I ask that\\nyou now honor one of the binding agreements between us.”\\n\\n“Which one, captain?”\\n\\n“You and your companions must be placed in confinement until I see fit\\nto set you free.”\\n\\n“You’re in command,” I answered, gaping at him. “But may I address a\\nquestion to you?”\\n\\n“You may not, sir.”\\n\\nAfter that, I stopped objecting and started obeying, since resistance\\nwas useless.\\n\\nI went below to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil, and I\\ninformed them of the captain’s decision. I’ll let the reader decide\\nhow this news was received by the Canadian. In any case, there was no\\ntime for explanations. Four crewmen were waiting at the door, and they\\nled us to the cell where we had spent our first night aboard the\\nNautilus.\\n\\nNed Land tried to lodge a complaint, but the only answer he got was a\\ndoor shut in his face.\\n\\n“Will master tell me what this means?” Conseil asked me.\\n\\nI told my companions what had happened. They were as astonished as I\\nwas, but no wiser.\\n\\nThen I sank into deep speculation, and Captain Nemo’s strange facial\\nseizure kept haunting me. I was incapable of connecting two ideas in\\nlogical order, and I had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses, when\\nI was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words from Ned Land:\\n\\n“Well, look here! Lunch is served!”\\n\\nIndeed, the table had been laid. Apparently Captain Nemo had given\\nthis order at the same time he commanded the Nautilus to pick up\\nspeed.\\n\\n“Will master allow me to make him a recommendation?” Conseil asked me.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” I replied.\\n\\n“Well, master needs to eat his lunch! It’s prudent, because we have no\\nidea what the future holds.”\\n\\n“You’re right, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” Ned Land said, “they’ve only given us the standard\\nmenu.”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” Conseil answered, “what would you say if they’d given\\nus no lunch at all?”\\n\\nThis dose of sanity cut the harpooner’s complaints clean off.\\n\\nWe sat down at the table. Our meal proceeded pretty much in silence. I\\nate very little. Conseil, everlastingly prudent, “force-fed” himself;\\nand despite the menu, Ned Land didn’t waste a bite. Then, lunch over,\\neach of us propped himself in a corner.\\n\\nJust then the luminous globe lighting our cell went out, leaving us in\\nprofound darkness. Ned Land soon dozed off, and to my astonishment,\\nConseil also fell into a heavy slumber. I was wondering what could\\nhave caused this urgent need for sleep, when I felt a dense torpor\\nsaturate my brain. I tried to keep my eyes open, but they closed in\\nspite of me. I was in the grip of anguished hallucinations. Obviously\\nsome sleep-inducing substance had been laced into the food we’d just\\neaten! So imprisonment wasn’t enough to conceal Captain Nemo’s plans\\nfrom us—sleep was needed as well!\\n\\nThen I heard the hatches close. The sea’s undulations, which had been\\ncreating a gentle rocking motion, now ceased. Had the Nautilus left\\nthe surface of the ocean? Was it reentering the motionless strata deep\\nin the sea?\\n\\nI tried to fight off this drowsiness. It was impossible. My breathing\\ngrew weaker. I felt a mortal chill freeze my dull, nearly paralyzed\\nlimbs. Like little domes of lead, my lids fell over my eyes. I\\ncouldn’t raise them. A morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, seized my\\nwhole being. Then the visions disappeared and left me in utter\\noblivion.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24\\n\\nThe Coral Realm\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY I woke up with my head unusually clear. Much to my\\nsurprise, I was in my stateroom. No doubt my companions had been put\\nback in their cabin without noticing it any more than I had. Like me,\\nthey would have no idea what took place during the night, and to\\nunravel this mystery I could count only on some future happenstance.\\n\\nI then considered leaving my stateroom. Was I free or still a\\nprisoner? Perfectly free. I opened my door, headed down the gangways,\\nand climbed the central companionway. Hatches that had been closed the\\nday before were now open. I arrived on the platform.\\n\\nNed Land and Conseil were there waiting for me. I questioned\\nthem. They knew nothing. Lost in a heavy sleep of which they had no\\nmemory, they were quite startled to be back in their cabin.\\n\\nAs for the Nautilus, it seemed as tranquil and mysterious as ever. It\\nwas cruising on the surface of the waves at a moderate speed. Nothing\\nseemed to have changed on board.\\n\\nNed Land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes. It was\\ndeserted. The Canadian sighted nothing new on the horizon, neither\\nsail nor shore. A breeze was blowing noisily from the west, and\\ndisheveled by the wind, long billows made the submersible roll very\\nnoticeably.\\n\\nAfter renewing its air, the Nautilus stayed at an average depth of\\nfifteen meters, enabling it to return quickly to the surface of the\\nwaves. And, contrary to custom, it executed such a maneuver several\\ntimes during that day of January 19. The chief officer would then\\nclimb onto the platform, and his usual phrase would ring through the\\nship’s interior.\\n\\nAs for Captain Nemo, he didn’t appear. Of the other men on board, I\\nsaw only my emotionless steward, who served me with his usual mute\\nefficiency.\\n\\nNear two o’clock I was busy organizing my notes in the lounge, when\\nthe captain opened the door and appeared. I bowed to him. He gave me\\nan almost imperceptible bow in return, without saying a word to me. I\\nresumed my work, hoping he might give me some explanation of the\\nprevious afternoon’s events. He did nothing of the sort. I stared at\\nhim. His face looked exhausted; his reddened eyes hadn’t been\\nrefreshed by sleep; his facial features expressed profound sadness,\\nreal chagrin. He walked up and down, sat and stood, picked up a book\\nat random, discarded it immediately, consulted his instruments without\\ntaking his customary notes, and seemed unable to rest easy for an\\ninstant.\\n\\nFinally he came over to me and said:\\n\\n“Are you a physician, Professor Aronnax?”\\n\\nThis inquiry was so unexpected that I stared at him a good while\\nwithout replying.\\n\\n“Are you a physician?” he repeated. “Several of your scientific\\ncolleagues took their degrees in medicine, such as Gratiolet,\\nMoquin-Tandon, and others.”\\n\\n“That’s right,” I said, “I am a doctor, I used to be on call at the\\nhospitals. I was in practice for several years before joining the\\nmuseum.”\\n\\n“Excellent, sir.”\\n\\nMy reply obviously pleased Captain Nemo. But not knowing what he was\\ndriving at, I waited for further questions, ready to reply as\\ncircumstances dictated.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” the captain said to me, “would you consent to\\ngive your medical attentions to one of my men?”\\n\\n“Someone is sick?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“I’m ready to go with you.”\\n\\n“Come.”\\n\\nI admit that my heart was pounding. Lord knows why, but I saw a\\ndefinite connection between this sick crewman and yesterday’s\\nhappenings, and the mystery of those events concerned me at least as\\nmuch as the man’s sickness.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo led me to the Nautilus’s stern and invited me into a\\ncabin located next to the sailors’ quarters.\\n\\nOn a bed there lay a man some forty years old, with strongly molded\\nfeatures, the very image of an Anglo-Saxon.\\n\\nI bent over him. Not only was he sick, he was wounded. Swathed in\\nblood-soaked linen, his head was resting on a folded pillow. I undid\\nthe linen bandages, while the wounded man gazed with great staring\\neyes and let me proceed without making a single complaint.\\n\\nIt was a horrible wound. The cranium had been smashed open by some\\nblunt instrument, leaving the naked brains exposed, and the cerebral\\nmatter had suffered deep abrasions. Blood clots had formed in this\\ndissolving mass, taking on the color of wine dregs. Both contusion and\\nconcussion of the brain had occurred. The sick man’s breathing was\\nlabored, and muscle spasms quivered in his face. Cerebral inflammation\\nwas complete and had brought on a paralysis of movement and sensation.\\n\\nI took the wounded man’s pulse. It was intermittent. The body’s\\nextremities were already growing cold, and I saw that death was\\napproaching without any possibility of my holding it in check. After\\ndressing the poor man’s wound, I redid the linen bandages around his\\nhead, and I turned to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“How did he get this wound?” I asked him.\\n\\n“That’s not important,” the captain replied evasively. “The Nautilus\\nsuffered a collision that cracked one of the engine levers, and it\\nstruck this man. My chief officer was standing beside him. This man\\nleaped forward to intercept the blow. A brother lays down his life for\\nhis brother, a friend for his friend, what could be simpler? That’s\\nthe law for everyone on board the Nautilus. But what’s your diagnosis\\nof his condition?”\\n\\nI hesitated to speak my mind.\\n\\n“You may talk freely,” the captain told me. “This man doesn’t\\nunderstand French.”\\n\\nI took a last look at the wounded man, then I replied:\\n\\n“This man will be dead in two hours.”\\n\\n“Nothing can save him?”\\n\\n“Nothing.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo clenched his fists, and tears slid from his eyes, which I\\nhad thought incapable of weeping.\\n\\nFor a few moments more I observed the dying man, whose life was ebbing\\nlittle by little. He grew still more pale under the electric light\\nthat bathed his deathbed. I looked at his intelligent head, furrowed\\nwith premature wrinkles that misfortune, perhaps misery, had etched\\nlong before. I was hoping to detect the secret of his life in the last\\nwords that might escape from his lips!\\n\\n“You may go, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo told me.\\n\\nI left the captain in the dying man’s cabin and I repaired to my\\nstateroom, very moved by this scene. All day long I was aquiver with\\ngruesome forebodings. That night I slept poorly, and between my fitful\\ndreams, I thought I heard a distant moaning, like a funeral dirge. Was\\nit a prayer for the dead, murmured in that language I couldn’t\\nunderstand?\\n\\nThe next morning I climbed on deck. Captain Nemo was already there. As\\nsoon as he saw me, he came over.\\n\\n“Professor,” he said to me, “would it be convenient for you to make an\\nunderwater excursion today?”\\n\\n“With my companions?” I asked.\\n\\n“If they’re agreeable.”\\n\\n“We’re yours to command, captain.”\\n\\n“Then kindly put on your diving suits.”\\n\\nAs for the dead or dying man, he hadn’t come into the picture. I\\nrejoined Ned Land and Conseil. I informed them of Captain Nemo’s\\nproposition. Conseil was eager to accept, and this time the Canadian\\nproved perfectly amenable to going with us.\\n\\nIt was eight o’clock in the morning. By 8:30 we were suited up for\\nthis new stroll and equipped with our two devices for lighting and\\nbreathing. The double door opened, and accompanied by Captain Nemo\\nwith a dozen crewmen following, we set foot on the firm seafloor where\\nthe Nautilus was resting, ten meters down.\\n\\nA gentle slope gravitated to an uneven bottom whose depth was about\\nfifteen fathoms. This bottom was completely different from the one I\\nhad visited during my first excursion under the waters of the Pacific\\nOcean. Here I saw no fine-grained sand, no underwater prairies, not\\none open-sea forest. I immediately recognized the wondrous region in\\nwhich Captain Nemo did the honors that day. It was the coral realm.\\n\\nIn the zoophyte branch, class Alcyonaria, one finds the order\\nGorgonaria, which contains three groups: sea fans, isidian polyps, and\\ncoral polyps. It’s in this last that precious coral belongs, an\\nunusual substance that, at different times, has been classified in the\\nmineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. Medicine to the ancients,\\njewelry to the moderns, it wasn’t decisively placed in the animal\\nkingdom until 1694, by Peysonnel of Marseilles.\\n\\nA coral is a unit of tiny animals assembled over a polypary that’s\\nbrittle and stony in nature. These polyps have a unique generating\\nmechanism that reproduces them via the budding process, and they have\\nan individual existence while also participating in a communal\\nlife. Hence they embody a sort of natural socialism. I was familiar\\nwith the latest research on this bizarre zoophyte—which turns to stone\\nwhile taking on a tree form, as some naturalists have very aptly\\nobserved—and nothing could have been more fascinating to me than to\\nvisit one of these petrified forests that nature has planted on the\\nbottom of the sea.\\n\\nWe turned on our Ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal in the\\nprocess of forming, which, given time, will someday close off this\\nwhole part of the Indian Ocean. Our path was bordered by hopelessly\\ntangled bushes, formed from snarls of shrubs all covered with little\\nstar-shaped, white-streaked flowers. Only, contrary to plants on\\nshore, these tree forms become attached to rocks on the seafloor by\\nheading from top to bottom.\\n\\nOur lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over\\nthese brightly colored boughs. I fancied I saw these cylindrical,\\nmembrane-filled tubes trembling beneath the water’s undulations. I was\\ntempted to gather their fresh petals, which were adorned with delicate\\ntentacles, some newly in bloom, others barely opened, while nimble\\nfish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds. But\\nif my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive, lively\\ncreatures, an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony. The\\nwhite petals retracted into their red sheaths, the flowers vanished\\nbefore my eyes, and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples.\\n\\nSheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable\\nspecimens of this zoophyte. This coral was the equal of those fished\\nup from the Mediterranean off the Barbary Coast or the shores of\\nFrance and Italy. With its bright colors, it lived up to those poetic\\nnames of blood flower and blood foam that the industry confers on its\\nfinest exhibits. Coral sells for as much as 500 francs per kilogram,\\nand in this locality the liquid strata hid enough to make the fortunes\\nof a whole host of coral fishermen. This valuable substance often\\nmerges with other polyparies, forming compact, hopelessly tangled\\nunits known as “macciota,” and I noted some wonderful pink samples of\\nthis coral.\\n\\nBut as the bushes shrank, the tree forms magnified. Actual petrified\\nthickets and long alcoves from some fantastic school of architecture\\nkept opening up before our steps. Captain Nemo entered beneath a dark\\ngallery whose gentle slope took us to a depth of 100 meters. The light\\nfrom our glass coils produced magical effects at times, lingering on\\nthe wrinkled roughness of some natural arch, or some overhang\\nsuspended like a chandelier, which our lamps flecked with fiery\\nsparks. Amid these shrubs of precious coral, I observed other polyps\\nno less unusual: melita coral, rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths,\\nthen a few tufts of genus Corallina, some green and others red,\\nactually a type of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts, which,\\nafter long disputes, naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable\\nkingdom. But as one intellectual has remarked, “Here, perhaps, is the\\nactual point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone, but\\nwithout breaking away from its crude starting point.”\\n\\nFinally, after two hours of walking, we reached a depth of about 300\\nmeters, in other words, the lowermost limit at which coral can begin\\nto form. But here it was no longer some isolated bush or a modest\\ngrove of low timber. It was an immense forest, huge mineral\\nvegetation, enormous petrified trees linked by garlands of elegant\\nhydras from the genus Plumularia, those tropical creepers of the sea,\\nall decked out in shades and gleams. We passed freely under their\\nlofty boughs, lost up in the shadows of the waves, while at our feet\\norgan-pipe coral, stony coral, star coral, fungus coral, and sea\\nanemone from the genus Caryophylia formed a carpet of flowers all\\nstrewn with dazzling gems.\\n\\nWhat an indescribable sight! Oh, if only we could share our feelings!\\nWhy were we imprisoned behind these masks of metal and glass! Why were\\nwe forbidden to talk with each other! At least let us lead the lives\\nof the fish that populate this liquid element, or better yet, the\\nlives of amphibians, which can spend long hours either at sea or on\\nshore, traveling through their double domain as their whims dictate!\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo had called a halt. My companions and I stopped\\nwalking, and turning around, I saw the crewmen form a semicircle\\naround their leader. Looking with greater care, I observed that four\\nof them were carrying on their shoulders an object that was oblong in\\nshape.\\n\\nAt this locality we stood in the center of a huge clearing surrounded\\nby the tall tree forms of this underwater forest. Our lamps cast a\\nsort of brilliant twilight over the area, making inordinately long\\nshadows on the seafloor. Past the boundaries of the clearing, the\\ndarkness deepened again, relieved only by little sparkles given off by\\nthe sharp crests of coral.\\n\\nNed Land and Conseil stood next to me. We stared, and it dawned on me\\nthat I was about to witness a strange scene. Observing the seafloor, I\\nsaw that it swelled at certain points from low bulges that were\\nencrusted with limestone deposits and arranged with a symmetry that\\nbetrayed the hand of man.\\n\\nIn the middle of the clearing, on a pedestal of roughly piled rocks,\\nthere stood a cross of coral, extending long arms you would have\\nthought were made of petrified blood.\\n\\nAt a signal from Captain Nemo, one of his men stepped forward and, a\\nfew feet from this cross, detached a mattock from his belt and began\\nto dig a hole.\\n\\nI finally understood! This clearing was a cemetery, this hole a grave,\\nthat oblong object the body of the man who must have died during the\\nnight! Captain Nemo and his men had come to bury their companion in\\nthis communal resting place on the inaccessible ocean floor!\\n\\nNo! My mind was reeling as never before! Never had ideas of such\\nimpact raced through my brain! I didn’t want to see what my eyes saw!\\n\\nMeanwhile the grave digging went slowly. Fish fled here and there as\\ntheir retreat was disturbed. I heard the pick ringing on the limestone\\nsoil, its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks when it hit a stray\\npiece of flint on the sea bottom. The hole grew longer, wider, and\\nsoon was deep enough to receive the body.\\n\\nThen the pallbearers approached. Wrapped in white fabric made from\\nfilaments of the fan mussel, the body was lowered into its watery\\ngrave. Captain Nemo, arms crossed over his chest, knelt in a posture\\nof prayer, as did all the friends of him who had loved them. . . . My\\ntwo companions and I bowed reverently.\\n\\nThe grave was then covered over with the rubble dug from the seafloor,\\nand it formed a low mound.\\n\\nWhen this was done, Captain Nemo and his men stood up; then they all\\napproached the grave, sank again on bended knee, and extended their\\nhands in a sign of final farewell. . . .\\n\\nThen the funeral party went back up the path to the Nautilus,\\nreturning beneath the arches of the forest, through the thickets,\\nalong the coral bushes, going steadily higher.\\n\\nFinally the ship’s rays appeared. Their luminous trail guided us to\\nthe Nautilus. By one o’clock we had returned.\\n\\nAfter changing clothes, I climbed onto the platform, and in the grip\\nof dreadfully obsessive thoughts, I sat next to the beacon.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo rejoined me. I stood up and said to him:\\n\\n“So, as I predicted, that man died during the night?”\\n\\n“Yes, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo replied.\\n\\n“And now he rests beside his companions in that coral cemetery?”\\n\\n“Yes, forgotten by the world but not by us! We dig the graves, then\\nentrust the polyps with sealing away our dead for eternity!”\\n\\nAnd with a sudden gesture, the captain hid his face in his clenched\\nfists, vainly trying to hold back a sob. Then he added:\\n\\n“There lies our peaceful cemetery, hundreds of feet beneath the\\nsurface of the waves!”\\n\\n“At least, captain, your dead can sleep serenely there, out of the\\nreach of sharks!”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” Captain Nemo replied solemnly, “of sharks and men!”\\n\\n\\nEND OF THE FIRST PART\\n\\n\\n\\nSECOND PART\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\nThe Indian Ocean\\n\\n\\nNOW WE BEGIN the second part of this voyage under the seas. The first\\nended in that moving scene at the coral cemetery, which left a\\nprofound impression on my mind. And so Captain Nemo would live out his\\nlife entirely in the heart of this immense sea, and even his grave lay\\nready in its impenetrable depths. There the last sleep of the\\nNautilus’s occupants, friends bound together in death as in life,\\nwould be disturbed by no monster of the deep! “No man either!” the\\ncaptain had added.\\n\\nAlways that same fierce, implacable defiance of human society!\\n\\nAs for me, I was no longer content with the hypotheses that satisfied\\nConseil. That fine lad persisted in seeing the Nautilus’s commander as\\nmerely one of those unappreciated scientists who repay humanity’s\\nindifference with contempt. For Conseil, the captain was still a\\nmisunderstood genius who, tired of the world’s deceptions, had been\\ndriven to take refuge in this inaccessible environment where he was\\nfree to follow his instincts. But to my mind, this hypothesis\\nexplained only one side of Captain Nemo.\\n\\nIn fact, the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in\\nprison and put to sleep, the captain’s violent precaution of snatching\\nfrom my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon, and the fatal\\nwound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered by the\\nNautilus, all led me down a plain trail. No! Captain Nemo wasn’t\\ncontent simply to avoid humanity! His fearsome submersible served not\\nonly his quest for freedom, but also, perhaps, it was used in\\nlord-knows-what schemes of dreadful revenge.\\n\\nRight now, nothing is clear to me, I still glimpse only glimmers in\\nthe dark, and I must limit my pen, as it were, to taking dictation\\nfrom events.\\n\\nBut nothing binds us to Captain Nemo. He believes that escaping from\\nthe Nautilus is impossible. We are not even constrained by our word of\\nhonor. No promises fetter us. We’re simply captives, prisoners\\nmasquerading under the name “guests” for the sake of everyday\\ncourtesy. Even so, Ned Land hasn’t given up all hope of recovering his\\nfreedom. He’s sure to take advantage of the first chance that comes\\nhis way. No doubt I will do likewise. And yet I will feel some regret\\nat making off with the Nautilus’s secrets, so generously unveiled for\\nus by Captain Nemo! Because, ultimately, should we detest or admire\\nthis man? Is he the persecutor or the persecuted? And in all honesty,\\nbefore I leave him forever, I want to finish this underwater tour of\\nthe world, whose first stages have been so magnificent. I want to\\nobserve the full series of these wonders gathered under the seas of\\nour globe. I want to see what no man has seen yet, even if I must pay\\nfor this insatiable curiosity with my life! What are my discoveries to\\ndate? Nothing, relatively speaking—since so far we’ve covered only\\n6,000 leagues across the Pacific!\\n\\nNevertheless, I’m well aware that the Nautilus is drawing near to\\npopulated shores, and if some chance for salvation becomes available\\nto us, it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my companions to my\\npassion for the unknown. I must go with them, perhaps even guide\\nthem. But will this opportunity ever arise? The human being, robbed of\\nhis free will, craves such an opportunity; but the scientist, forever\\ninquisitive, dreads it.\\n\\nThat day, January 21, 1868, the chief officer went at noon to take the\\nsun’s altitude. I climbed onto the platform, lit a cigar, and watched\\nhim at work. It seemed obvious to me that this man didn’t understand\\nFrench, because I made several remarks in a loud voice that were bound\\nto provoke him to some involuntary show of interest had he understood\\nthem; but he remained mute and emotionless.\\n\\nWhile he took his sights with his sextant, one of the Nautilus’s\\nsailors—that muscular man who had gone with us to Crespo Island during\\nour first underwater excursion—came up to clean the glass panes of the\\nbeacon. I then examined the fittings of this mechanism, whose power\\nwas increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed like\\nthose in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused. This\\nelectric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum illuminating\\npower. In essence, its light was generated in a vacuum, insuring both\\nits steadiness and intensity. Such a vacuum also reduced wear on the\\ngraphite points between which the luminous arc expanded. This was an\\nimportant savings for Captain Nemo, who couldn’t easily renew\\nthem. But under these conditions, wear and tear were almost\\nnonexistent.\\n\\nWhen the Nautilus was ready to resume its underwater travels, I went\\nbelow again to the lounge. The hatches closed once more, and our\\ncourse was set due west.\\n\\nWe then plowed the waves of the Indian Ocean, vast liquid plains with\\nan area of 550,000,000 hectares, whose waters are so transparent it\\nmakes you dizzy to lean over their surface. There the Nautilus\\ngenerally drifted at a depth between 100 and 200 meters. It behaved in\\nthis way for some days. To anyone without my grand passion for the\\nsea, these hours would surely have seemed long and monotonous; but my\\ndaily strolls on the platform where I was revived by the life-giving\\nocean air, the sights in the rich waters beyond the lounge windows,\\nthe books to be read in the library, and the composition of my\\nmemoirs, took up all my time and left me without a moment of weariness\\nor boredom.\\n\\nAll in all, we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health. The diet\\non board agreed with us perfectly, and for my part, I could easily\\nhave gone without those changes of pace that Ned Land, in a spirit of\\nprotest, kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us. What’s more, in this\\nconstant temperature we didn’t even have to worry about catching\\ncolds. Besides, the ship had a good stock of the madrepore\\nDendrophylia, known in Provence by the name sea fennel, and a poultice\\nmade from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will furnish an excellent\\ncough medicine.\\n\\nFor some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet,\\nknown as gulls or sea mews. Some were skillfully slain, and when\\ncooked in a certain fashion, they make a very acceptable platter of\\nwater game. Among the great wind riders—carried over long distances\\nfrom every shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting\\nflights—I spotted some magnificent albatross, birds belonging to the\\nLongipennes (long-winged) family, whose discordant calls sound like\\nthe braying of an ass. The Totipalmes (fully webbed) family was\\nrepresented by swift frigate birds, nimbly catching fish at the\\nsurface, and by numerous tropic birds of the genus Phaeton, among\\nothers the red-tailed tropic bird, the size of a pigeon, its white\\nplumage shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark-hued\\nwings.\\n\\nThe Nautilus’s nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from the\\nhawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly\\nprized. Diving easily, these reptiles can remain a good while\\nunderwater by closing the fleshy valves located at the external\\nopenings of their nasal passages. When they were captured, some\\nhawksbills were still asleep inside their carapaces, a refuge from\\nother marine animals. The flesh of these turtles was nothing\\nmemorable, but their eggs made an excellent feast.\\n\\nAs for fish, they always filled us with wonderment when, staring\\nthrough the open panels, we could unveil the secrets of their aquatic\\nlives. I noted several species I hadn’t previously been able to\\nobserve.\\n\\nI’ll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the Red Sea, the sea of\\nthe East Indies, and that part of the ocean washing the coasts of\\nequinoctial America. Like turtles, armadillos, sea urchins, and\\ncrustaceans, these fish are protected by armor plate that’s neither\\nchalky nor stony but actual bone. Sometimes this armor takes the shape\\nof a solid triangle, sometimes that of a solid quadrangle. Among the\\ntriangular type, I noticed some half a decimeter long, with brown\\ntails, yellow fins, and wholesome, exquisitely tasty flesh; I even\\nrecommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water, a change,\\nincidentally, that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease. I’ll\\nalso mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large\\nprotuberances along the back; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on\\nthe underside of the body, which make good house pets like certain\\nbirds; boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony\\ncrusts, and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname “sea\\npigs”; then some trunkfish known as dromedaries, with tough, leathery\\nflesh and big conical humps.\\n\\nFrom the daily notes kept by Mr. Conseil, I also retrieve certain fish\\nfrom the genus Tetradon unique to these seas: southern puffers with\\nred backs and white chests distinguished by three lengthwise rows of\\nfilaments, and jugfish, seven inches long, decked out in the brightest\\ncolors. Then, as specimens of other genera, blowfish resembling a dark\\nbrown egg, furrowed with white bands, and lacking tails; globefish,\\ngenuine porcupines of the sea, armed with stings and able to inflate\\nthemselves until they look like a pin cushion bristling with needles;\\nseahorses common to every ocean; flying dragonfish with long snouts\\nand highly distended pectoral fins shaped like wings, which enable\\nthem, if not to fly, at least to spring into the air; spatula-shaped\\npaddlefish whose tails are covered with many scaly rings; snipefish\\nwith long jaws, excellent animals twenty-five centimeters long and\\ngleaming with the most cheerful colors; bluish gray dragonets with\\nwrinkled heads; myriads of leaping blennies with black stripes and\\nlong pectoral fins, gliding over the surface of the water with\\nprodigious speed; delicious sailfish that can hoist their fins in a\\nfavorable current like so many unfurled sails; splendid nurseryfish on\\nwhich nature has lavished yellow, azure, silver, and gold; yellow\\nmackerel with wings made of filaments; bullheads forever spattered\\nwith mud, which make distinct hissing sounds; sea robins whose livers\\nare thought to be poisonous; ladyfish that can flutter their eyelids;\\nfinally, archerfish with long, tubular snouts, real oceangoing\\nflycatchers, armed with a rifle unforeseen by either Remington or\\nChassepot: it slays insects by shooting them with a simple drop of\\nwater.\\n\\nFrom the eighty-ninth fish genus in Lacépède’s system of\\nclassification, belonging to his second subclass of bony fish\\n(characterized by gill covers and a bronchial membrane), I noted some\\nscorpionfish whose heads are adorned with stings and which have only\\none dorsal fin; these animals are covered with small scales, or have\\nnone at all, depending on the subgenus to which they belong. The\\nsecond subgenus gave us some Didactylus specimens three to four\\ndecimeters long, streaked with yellow, their heads having a\\nphantasmagoric appearance. As for the first subgenus, it furnished\\nseveral specimens of that bizarre fish aptly nicknamed “toadfish,”\\nwhose big head is sometimes gouged with deep cavities, sometimes\\nswollen with protuberances; bristling with stings and strewn with\\nnodules, it sports hideously irregular horns; its body and tail are\\nadorned with callosities; its stings can inflict dangerous injuries;\\nit’s repulsive and horrible.\\n\\nFrom January 21 to the 23rd, the Nautilus traveled at the rate of 250\\nleagues in twenty-four hours, hence 540 miles at twenty-two miles per\\nhour. If, during our trip, we were able to identify these different\\nvarieties of fish, it’s because they were attracted by our electric\\nlight and tried to follow alongside; but most of them were\\noutdistanced by our speed and soon fell behind; temporarily, however,\\na few managed to keep pace in the Nautilus’s waters.\\n\\nOn the morning of the 24th, in latitude 12 degrees 5’ south and\\nlongitude 94 degrees 33’, we raised Keeling Island, a madreporic\\nupheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees, which had been\\nvisited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy. The Nautilus cruised along\\na short distance off the shore of this desert island. Our dragnets\\nbrought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms plus some unusual\\nshells from the branch Mollusca. Captain Nemo’s treasures were\\nenhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula snail species,\\nto which I joined some pointed star coral, a sort of parasitic\\npolypary that often attaches itself to seashells.\\n\\nSoon Keeling Island disappeared below the horizon, and our course was\\nset to the northwest, toward the tip of the Indian peninsula.\\n\\n“Civilization!” Ned Land told me that day. “Much better than those\\nPapuan Islands where we ran into more savages than venison! On this\\nIndian shore, professor, there are roads and railways, English,\\nFrench, and Hindu villages. We wouldn’t go five miles without bumping\\ninto a fellow countryman. Come on now, isn’t it time for our sudden\\ndeparture from Captain Nemo?”\\n\\n“No, no, Ned,” I replied in a very firm tone. “Let’s ride it out, as\\nyou seafaring fellows say. The Nautilus is approaching populated\\nareas. It’s going back toward Europe, let it take us there. After we\\narrive in home waters, we can do as we see fit. Besides, I don’t\\nimagine Captain Nemo will let us go hunting on the coasts of Malabar\\nor Coromandel as he did in the forests of New Guinea.”\\n\\n“Well, sir, can’t we manage without his permission?”\\n\\nI didn’t answer the Canadian. I wanted no arguments. Deep down, I was\\ndetermined to fully exploit the good fortune that had put me on board\\nthe Nautilus.\\n\\nAfter leaving Keeling Island, our pace got generally slower. It also\\ngot more unpredictable, often taking us to great depths. Several times\\nwe used our slanting fins, which internal levers could set at an\\noblique angle to our waterline. Thus we went as deep as two or three\\nkilometers down but without ever verifying the lowest depths of this\\nsea near India, which soundings of 13,000 meters have been unable to\\nreach. As for the temperature in these lower strata, the thermometer\\nalways and invariably indicated 4 degrees centigrade. I merely\\nobserved that in the upper layers, the water was always colder over\\nshallows than in the open sea.\\n\\nOn January 25, the ocean being completely deserted, the Nautilus spent\\nthe day on the surface, churning the waves with its powerful propeller\\nand making them spurt to great heights. Under these conditions, who\\nwouldn’t have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean? I spent\\nthree-quarters of the day on the platform. I stared at the\\nsea. Nothing on the horizon, except near four o’clock in the afternoon\\na long steamer to the west, running on our opposite tack. Its masting\\nwas visible for an instant, but it couldn’t have seen the Nautilus\\nbecause we were lying too low in the water. I imagine that steamboat\\nbelonged to the Peninsular & Oriental line, which provides service\\nfrom the island of Ceylon to Sidney, also calling at King George Sound\\nand Melbourne.\\n\\nAt five o’clock in the afternoon, just before that brief twilight that\\nlinks day with night in tropical zones, Conseil and I marveled at an\\nunusual sight.\\n\\nIt was a delightful animal whose discovery, according to the ancients,\\nis a sign of good luck. Aristotle, Athenaeus, Pliny, and Oppian\\nstudied its habits and lavished on its behalf all the scientific\\npoetry of Greece and Italy. They called it “nautilus” and “pompilius.”\\nBut modern science has not endorsed these designations, and this\\nmollusk is now known by the name argonaut.\\n\\nAnyone consulting Conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad that\\nthe branch Mollusca is divided into five classes; that the first class\\nfeatures the Cephalopoda (whose members are sometimes naked, sometimes\\ncovered with a shell), which consists of two families, the\\nDibranchiata and the Tetrabranchiata, which are distinguished by their\\nnumber of gills; that the family Dibranchiata includes three genera,\\nthe argonaut, the squid, and the cuttlefish, and that the family\\nTetrabranchiata contains only one genus, the nautilus. After this\\ncatalog, if some recalcitrant listener confuses the argonaut, which is\\nacetabuliferous (in other words, a bearer of suction tubes), with the\\nnautilus, which is tentaculiferous (a bearer of tentacles), it will be\\nsimply unforgivable.\\n\\nNow, it was a school of argonauts then voyaging on the surface of the\\nocean. We could count several hundred of them. They belonged to that\\nspecies of argonaut covered with protuberances and exclusive to the\\nseas near India.\\n\\nThese graceful mollusks were swimming backward by means of their\\nlocomotive tubes, sucking water into these tubes and then expelling\\nit. Six of their eight tentacles were long, thin, and floated on the\\nwater, while the other two were rounded into palms and spread to the\\nwind like light sails. I could see perfectly their undulating,\\nspiral-shaped shells, which Cuvier aptly compared to an elegant\\ncockleboat. It’s an actual boat indeed. It transports the animal that\\nsecretes it without the animal sticking to it.\\n\\n“The argonaut is free to leave its shell,” I told Conseil, “but it\\nnever does.”\\n\\n“Not unlike Captain Nemo,” Conseil replied sagely. “Which is why he\\nshould have christened his ship the Argonaut.”\\n\\nFor about an hour the Nautilus cruised in the midst of this school of\\nmollusks. Then, lord knows why, they were gripped with a sudden\\nfear. As if at a signal, every sail was abruptly lowered; arms folded,\\nbodies contracted, shells turned over by changing their center of\\ngravity, and the whole flotilla disappeared under the waves. It was\\ninstantaneous, and no squadron of ships ever maneuvered with greater\\ntogetherness.\\n\\nJust then night fell suddenly, and the waves barely surged in the\\nbreeze, spreading placidly around the Nautilus’s side plates.\\n\\nThe next day, January 26, we cut the equator on the 82nd meridian and\\nwe reentered the northern hemisphere.\\n\\nDuring that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an\\nescort. Dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them\\nextremely dangerous. There were Port Jackson sharks with a brown back,\\na whitish belly, and eleven rows of teeth, bigeye sharks with necks\\nmarked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye,\\nand Isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark\\nspeckles. Often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window\\nwith a violence less than comforting. By this point Ned Land had lost\\nall self-control. He wanted to rise to the surface of the waves and\\nharpoon the monsters, especially certain smooth-hound sharks whose\\nmouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic, and some big\\nfive-meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him. But\\nthe Nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest\\nof these man-eaters.\\n\\nOn January 27, at the entrance to the huge Bay of Bengal, we\\nrepeatedly encountered a gruesome sight: human corpses floating on the\\nsurface of the waves! Carried by the Ganges to the high seas, these\\nwere deceased Indian villagers who hadn’t been fully devoured by\\nvultures, the only morticians in these parts. But there was no\\nshortage of sharks to assist them with their undertaking chores.\\n\\nNear seven o’clock in the evening, the Nautilus lay half submerged,\\nnavigating in the midst of milky white waves. As far as the eye could\\nsee, the ocean seemed lactified. Was it an effect of the moon’s rays?\\nNo, because the new moon was barely two days old and was still lost\\nbelow the horizon in the sun’s rays. The entire sky, although lit up\\nby stellar radiation, seemed pitch-black in comparison with the\\nwhiteness of these waters.\\n\\nConseil couldn’t believe his eyes, and he questioned me about the\\ncauses of this odd phenomenon. Luckily I was in a position to answer\\nhim.\\n\\n“That’s called a milk sea,” I told him, “a vast expanse of white waves\\noften seen along the coasts of Amboina and in these waterways.”\\n\\n“But,” Conseil asked, “could master tell me the cause of this effect,\\nbecause I presume this water hasn’t really changed into milk!”\\n\\n“No, my boy, and this whiteness that amazes you is merely due to the\\npresence of myriads of tiny creatures called infusoria, a sort of\\ndiminutive glowworm that’s colorless and gelatinous in appearance, as\\nthick as a strand of hair, and no longer than one-fifth of a\\nmillimeter. Some of these tiny creatures stick together over an area\\nof several leagues.”\\n\\n“Several leagues!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy, and don’t even try to compute the number of these\\ninfusoria. You won’t pull it off, because if I’m not mistaken, certain\\nnavigators have cruised through milk seas for more than forty miles.”\\n\\nI’m not sure that Conseil heeded my recommendation, because he seemed\\nto be deep in thought, no doubt trying to calculate how many\\none-fifths of a millimeter are found in forty square miles. As for me,\\nI continued to observe this phenomenon. For several hours the\\nNautilus’s spur sliced through these whitish waves, and I watched it\\nglide noiselessly over this soapy water, as if it were cruising\\nthrough those foaming eddies that a bay’s currents and countercurrents\\nsometimes leave between each other.\\n\\nNear midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue, but behind us\\nall the way to the horizon, the skies kept mirroring the whiteness of\\nthose waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy glow of\\nan aurora borealis.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nA New Proposition from Captain Nemo\\n\\n\\nON JANUARY 28, in latitude 9 degrees 4’ north, when the Nautilus\\nreturned at noon to the surface of the sea, it lay in sight of land\\nsome eight miles to the west. Right off, I observed a cluster of\\nmountains about 2,000 feet high, whose shapes were very whimsically\\nsculpted. After our position fix, I reentered the lounge, and when our\\nbearings were reported on the chart, I saw that we were off the island\\nof Ceylon, that pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the Indian\\npeninsula.\\n\\nI went looking in the library for a book about this island, one of the\\nmost fertile in the world. Sure enough, I found a volume entitled\\nCeylon and the Singhalese by H. C. Sirr, Esq. Reentering the lounge, I\\nfirst noted the bearings of Ceylon, on which antiquity lavished so\\nmany different names. It was located between latitude 5 degrees 55’\\nand 9 degrees 49’ north, and between longitude 79 degrees 42’ and 82\\ndegrees 4’ east of the meridian of Greenwich; its length is 275 miles;\\nits maximum width, 150 miles; its circumference, 900 miles; its\\nsurface area, 24,448 square miles, in other words, a little smaller\\nthan that of Ireland.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo and his chief officer appeared.\\n\\nThe captain glanced at the chart. Then, turning to me:\\n\\n“The island of Ceylon,” he said, “is famous for its pearl\\nfisheries. Would you be interested, Professor Aronnax, in visiting one\\nof those fisheries?”\\n\\n“Certainly, captain.”\\n\\n“Fine. It’s easily done. Only, when we see the fisheries, we’ll see no\\nfishermen. The annual harvest hasn’t yet begun. No matter. I’ll give\\norders to make for the Gulf of Mannar, and we’ll arrive there late\\ntonight.”\\n\\nThe captain said a few words to his chief officer who went out\\nimmediately. Soon the Nautilus reentered its liquid element, and the\\npressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth of thirty\\nfeet.\\n\\nWith the chart under my eyes, I looked for the Gulf of Mannar. I found\\nit by the 9th parallel off the northwestern shores of Ceylon. It was\\nformed by the long curve of little Mannar Island. To reach it we had\\nto go all the way up Ceylon’s west coast.\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo then told me, “there are pearl fisheries in\\nthe Bay of Bengal, the seas of the East Indies, the seas of China and\\nJapan, plus those seas south of the United States, the Gulf of Panama\\nand the Gulf of California; but it’s off Ceylon that such fishing\\nreaps its richest rewards. No doubt we’ll be arriving a little\\nearly. Fishermen gather in the Gulf of Mannar only during the month of\\nMarch, and for thirty days some 300 boats concentrate on the lucrative\\nharvest of these treasures from the sea. Each boat is manned by ten\\noarsmen and ten fishermen. The latter divide into two groups, dive in\\nrotation, and descend to a depth of twelve meters with the help of a\\nheavy stone clutched between their feet and attached by a rope to\\ntheir boat.”\\n\\n“You mean,” I said, “that such primitive methods are still all that\\nthey use?”\\n\\n“All,” Captain Nemo answered me, “although these fisheries belong to\\nthe most industrialized people in the world, the English, to whom the\\nTreaty of Amiens granted them in 1802.”\\n\\n“Yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman\\nservice in such work.”\\n\\n“Yes, since those poor fishermen can’t stay long underwater. On his\\nvoyage to Ceylon, the Englishman Percival made much of a Kaffir who\\nstayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface, but I find\\nthat hard to believe. I know that some divers can last up to\\nfifty-seven seconds, and highly skillful ones to eighty-seven; but\\nsuch men are rare, and when the poor fellows climb back on board, the\\nwater coming out of their noses and ears is tinted with blood. I\\nbelieve the average time underwater that these fishermen can tolerate\\nis thirty seconds, during which they hastily stuff their little nets\\nwith all the pearl oysters they can tear loose. But these fishermen\\ngenerally don’t live to advanced age: their vision weakens, ulcers\\nbreak out on their eyes, sores form on their bodies, and some are even\\nstricken with apoplexy on the ocean floor.”\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “it’s a sad occupation, and one that exists only to\\ngratify the whims of fashion. But tell me, captain, how many oysters\\ncan a boat fish up in a workday?”\\n\\n“About 40,000 to 50,000. It’s even said that in 1814, when the English\\ngovernment went fishing on its own behalf, its divers worked just\\ntwenty days and brought up 76,000,000 oysters.”\\n\\n“At least,” I asked, “the fishermen are well paid, aren’t they?”\\n\\n“Hardly, professor. In Panama they make just $1.00 per week. In most\\nplaces they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl, and\\nthey bring up so many that have none!”\\n\\n“Only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich!\\nThat’s atrocious!”\\n\\n“On that note, professor,” Captain Nemo told me, “you and your\\ncompanions will visit the Mannar oysterbank, and if by chance some\\neager fisherman arrives early, well, we can watch him at work.”\\n\\n“That suits me, captain.”\\n\\n“By the way, Professor Aronnax, you aren’t afraid of sharks, are you?”\\n\\n“Sharks?” I exclaimed.\\n\\nThis struck me as a pretty needless question, to say the least.\\n\\n“Well?” Captain Nemo went on.\\n\\n“I admit, captain, I’m not yet on very familiar terms with that genus\\nof fish.”\\n\\n“We’re used to them, the rest of us,” Captain Nemo answered. “And in\\ntime you will be too. Anyhow, we’ll be armed, and on our way we might\\nhunt a man-eater or two. It’s a fascinating sport. So, professor, I’ll\\nsee you tomorrow, bright and early.”\\n\\nThis said in a carefree tone, Captain Nemo left the lounge.\\n\\nIf you’re invited to hunt bears in the Swiss mountains, you might say:\\n“Oh good, I get to go bear hunting tomorrow!” If you’re invited to\\nhunt lions on the Atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of India, you\\nmight say: “Ha! Now’s my chance to hunt lions and tigers!” But if\\nyou’re invited to hunt sharks in their native element, you might want\\nto think it over before accepting.\\n\\nAs for me, I passed a hand over my brow, where beads of cold sweat\\nwere busy forming.\\n\\n“Let’s think this over,” I said to myself, “and let’s take our\\ntime. Hunting otters in underwater forests, as we did in the forests\\nof Crespo Island, is an acceptable activity. But to roam the bottom of\\nthe sea when you’re almost certain to meet man-eaters in the\\nneighborhood, that’s another story! I know that in certain countries,\\nparticularly the Andaman Islands, Negroes don’t hesitate to attack\\nsharks, dagger in one hand and noose in the other; but I also know\\nthat many who face those fearsome animals don’t come back\\nalive. Besides, I’m not a Negro, and even if I were a Negro, in this\\ninstance I don’t think a little hesitation on my part would be out of\\nplace.”\\n\\nAnd there I was, fantasizing about sharks, envisioning huge jaws armed\\nwith multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half. I\\ncould already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle. And how I\\nresented the offhand manner in which the captain had extended his\\ndeplorable invitation! You would have thought it was an issue of going\\ninto the woods on some harmless fox hunt!\\n\\n“Thank heavens!” I said to myself. “Conseil will never want to come\\nalong, and that’ll be my excuse for not going with the captain.”\\n\\nAs for Ned Land, I admit I felt less confident of his wisdom. Danger,\\nhowever great, held a perennial attraction for his aggressive nature.\\n\\nI went back to reading Sirr’s book, but I leafed through it\\nmechanically. Between the lines I kept seeing fearsome, wide-open\\njaws.\\n\\nJust then Conseil and the Canadian entered with a calm, even gleeful\\nair. Little did they know what was waiting for them.\\n\\n“Ye gods, sir!” Ned Land told me. “Your Captain Nemo—the devil take\\nhim—has just made us a very pleasant proposition!”\\n\\n“Oh!” I said “You know about—”\\n\\n“With all due respect to master,” Conseil replied, “the Nautilus’s\\ncommander has invited us, together with master, for a visit tomorrow\\nto Ceylon’s magnificent pearl fisheries. He did so in the most cordial\\nterms and conducted himself like a true gentleman.”\\n\\n“He didn’t tell you anything else?”\\n\\n“Nothing, sir,” the Canadian replied. “He said you’d already discussed\\nthis little stroll.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” I said. “But didn’t he give you any details on—”\\n\\n“Not a one, Mr. Naturalist. You will be going with us, right?”\\n\\n“Me? Why yes, certainly, of course! I can see that you like the idea,\\nMr. Land.”\\n\\n“Yes! It will be a really unusual experience!”\\n\\n“And possibly dangerous!” I added in an insinuating tone.\\n\\n“Dangerous?” Ned Land replied. “A simple trip to an oysterbank?”\\n\\nAssuredly, Captain Nemo hadn’t seen fit to plant the idea of sharks in\\nthe minds of my companions. For my part, I stared at them with anxious\\neyes, as if they were already missing a limb or two. Should I alert\\nthem? Yes, surely, but I hardly knew how to go about it.\\n\\n“Would master,” Conseil said to me, “give us some background on pearl\\nfishing?”\\n\\n“On the fishing itself?” I asked. “Or on the occupational hazards\\nthat—”\\n\\n“On the fishing,” the Canadian replied. “Before we tackle the terrain,\\nit helps to be familiar with it.”\\n\\n“All right, sit down, my friends, and I’ll teach you everything I\\nmyself have just been taught by the Englishman H. C. Sirr!”\\n\\nNed and Conseil took seats on a couch, and right off the Canadian said\\nto me:\\n\\n“Sir, just what is a pearl exactly?”\\n\\n“My gallant Ned,” I replied, “for poets a pearl is a tear from the\\nsea; for Orientals it’s a drop of solidified dew; for the ladies it’s\\na jewel they can wear on their fingers, necks, and ears that’s oblong\\nin shape, glassy in luster, and formed from mother-of-pearl; for\\nchemists it’s a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate\\nwith a little gelatin protein; and finally, for naturalists it’s a\\nsimple festering secretion from the organ that produces\\nmother-of-pearl in certain bivalves.”\\n\\n“Branch Mollusca,” Conseil said, “class Acephala, order Testacea.”\\n\\n“Correct, my scholarly Conseil. Now then, those Testacea capable of\\nproducing pearls include rainbow abalone, turbo snails, giant clams,\\nand saltwater scallops—briefly, all those that secrete\\nmother-of-pearl, in other words, that blue, azure, violet, or white\\nsubstance lining the insides of their valves.”\\n\\n“Are mussels included too?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Yes! The mussels of certain streams in Scotland, Wales, Ireland,\\nSaxony, Bohemia, and France.”\\n\\n“Good!” the Canadian replied. “From now on we’ll pay closer attention\\nto ‘em.”\\n\\n“But,” I went on, “for secreting pearls, the ideal mollusk is the\\npearl oyster Meleagrina margaritifera, that valuable shellfish. Pearls\\nresult simply from mother-of-pearl solidifying into a globular\\nshape. Either they stick to the oyster’s shell, or they become\\nembedded in the creature’s folds. On the valves a pearl sticks fast;\\non the flesh it lies loose. But its nucleus is always some small, hard\\nobject, say a sterile egg or a grain of sand, around which the\\nmother-of-pearl is deposited in thin, concentric layers over several\\nyears in succession.”\\n\\n“Can one find several pearls in the same oyster?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy. There are some shellfish that turn into real jewel\\ncoffers. They even mention one oyster, about which I remain dubious,\\nthat supposedly contained at least 150 sharks.”\\n\\n“150 sharks!” Ned Land yelped.\\n\\n“Did I say sharks?” I exclaimed hastily. “I meant 150 pearls. Sharks\\nwouldn’t make sense.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” Conseil said. “But will master now tell us how one goes\\nabout extracting these pearls?”\\n\\n“One proceeds in several ways, and often when pearls stick to the\\nvalves, fishermen even pull them loose with pliers. But usually the\\nshellfish are spread out on mats made from the esparto grass that\\ncovers the beaches. Thus they die in the open air, and by the end of\\nten days they’ve rotted sufficiently. Next they’re immersed in huge\\ntanks of salt water, then they’re opened up and washed. At this point\\nthe sorters begin their twofold task. First they remove the layers of\\nmother-of-pearl, which are known in the industry by the names\\nlegitimate silver, bastard white, or bastard black, and these are\\nshipped out in cases weighing 125 to 150 kilograms. Then they remove\\nthe oyster’s meaty tissue, boil it, and finally strain it, in order to\\nextract even the smallest pearls.”\\n\\n“Do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size?”\\nConseil asked.\\n\\n“Not only on their size,” I replied, “but also according to their\\nshape, their water—in other words, their color—and their orient—in\\nother words, that dappled, shimmering glow that makes them so\\ndelightful to the eye. The finest pearls are called virgin pearls, or\\nparagons; they form in isolation within the mollusk’s tissue. They’re\\nwhite, often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency, and\\nusually spherical or pear-shaped. The spherical ones are made into\\nbracelets; the pear-shaped ones into earrings, and since they’re the\\nmost valuable, they’re priced individually. The other pearls that\\nstick to the oyster’s shell are more erratically shaped and are priced\\nby weight. Finally, classed in the lowest order, the smallest pearls\\nare known by the name seed pearls; they’re priced by the measuring cup\\nand are used mainly in the creation of embroidery for church\\nvestments.”\\n\\n“But it must be a long, hard job, sorting out these pearls by size,”\\nthe Canadian said.\\n\\n“No, my friend. That task is performed with eleven strainers, or\\nsieves, that are pierced with different numbers of holes. Those pearls\\nstaying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes are in the first\\norder. Those not slipping through the sieves pierced with 100 to 800\\nholes are in the second order. Finally, those pearls for which one\\nuses strainers pierced with 900 to 1,000 holes make up the seed\\npearls.”\\n\\n“How ingenious,” Conseil said, “to reduce dividing and classifying\\npearls to a mechanical operation. And could master tell us the profits\\nbrought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters?”\\n\\n“According to Sirr’s book,” I replied, “these Ceylon fisheries are\\nfarmed annually for a total profit of 3,000,000 man-eaters.”\\n\\n“Francs!” Conseil rebuked.\\n\\n“Yes, francs! 3,000,000 francs!” I went on. “But I don’t think these\\nfisheries bring in the returns they once did. Similarly, the Central\\nAmerican fisheries used to make an annual profit of 4,000,000 francs\\nduring the reign of King Charles V, but now they bring in only\\ntwo-thirds of that amount. All in all, it’s estimated that 9,000,000\\nfrancs is the current yearly return for the whole pearl-harvesting\\nindustry.”\\n\\n“But,” Conseil asked, “haven’t certain famous pearls been quoted at\\nextremely high prices?”\\n\\n“Yes, my boy. They say Julius Caesar gave Servilia a pearl worth\\n120,000 francs in our currency.”\\n\\n“I’ve even heard stories,” the Canadian said, “about some lady in\\nancient times who drank pearls in vinegar.”\\n\\n“Cleopatra,” Conseil shot back.\\n\\n“It must have tasted pretty bad,” Ned Land added.\\n\\n“Abominable, Ned my friend,” Conseil replied. “But when a little glass\\nof vinegar is worth 1,500,000 francs, its taste is a small price to\\npay.”\\n\\n“I’m sorry I didn’t marry the gal,” the Canadian said, throwing up his\\nhands with an air of discouragement.\\n\\n“Ned Land married to Cleopatra?” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“But I was all set to tie the knot, Conseil,” the Canadian replied in\\nall seriousness, “and it wasn’t my fault the whole business fell\\nthrough. I even bought a pearl necklace for my fiancΘe, Kate Tender,\\nbut she married somebody else instead. Well, that necklace cost me\\nonly $1.50, but you can absolutely trust me on this, professor, its\\npearls were so big, they wouldn’t have gone through that strainer with\\ntwenty holes.”\\n\\n“My gallant Ned,” I replied, laughing, “those were artificial pearls,\\nordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with Essence of\\nOrient.”\\n\\n“Wow!” the Canadian replied. “That Essence of Orient must sell for\\nquite a large sum.”\\n\\n“As little as zero! It comes from the scales of a European carp, it’s\\nnothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water and is\\npreserved in ammonia. It’s worthless.”\\n\\n“Maybe that’s why Kate Tender married somebody else,” replied Mr. Land\\nphilosophically.\\n\\n“But,” I said, “getting back to pearls of great value, I don’t think\\nany sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned by\\nCaptain Nemo.”\\n\\n“This one?” Conseil said, pointing to a magnificent jewel in its glass\\ncase.\\n\\n“Exactly. And I’m certainly not far off when I estimate its value at\\n2,000,000 . . . uh . . .”\\n\\n“Francs!” Conseil said quickly.\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “2,000,000 francs, and no doubt all it cost our captain\\nwas the effort to pick it up.”\\n\\n“Ha!” Ned Land exclaimed. “During our stroll tomorrow, who says we\\nwon’t run into one just like it?”\\n\\n“Bah!” Conseil put in.\\n\\n“And why not?”\\n\\n“What good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“Here, no,” Ned Land said. “But elsewhere. . . .”\\n\\n“Oh! Elsewhere!” Conseil put in, shaking his head.\\n\\n“In fact,” I said, “Mr. Land is right. And if we ever brought back to\\nEurope or America a pearl worth millions, it would make the story of\\nour adventures more authentic—and much more rewarding.”\\n\\n“That’s how I see it,” the Canadian said.\\n\\n“But,” said Conseil, who perpetually returned to the didactic side of\\nthings, “is this pearl fishing ever dangerous?”\\n\\n“No,” I replied quickly, “especially if one takes certain\\nprecautions.”\\n\\n“What risks would you run in a job like that?” Ned Land\\nsaid. “Swallowing a few gulps of salt water?”\\n\\n“Whatever you say, Ned.” Then, trying to imitate Captain Nemo’s\\ncarefree tone, I asked, “By the way, gallant Ned, are you afraid of\\nsharks?”\\n\\n“Me?” the Canadian replied. “I’m a professional harpooner! It’s my job\\nto make a mockery of them!”\\n\\n“It isn’t an issue,” I said, “of fishing for them with a swivel hook,\\nhoisting them onto the deck of a ship, chopping off the tail with a\\nsweep of the ax, opening the belly, ripping out the heart, and tossing\\nit into the sea.”\\n\\n“So it’s an issue of . . . ?”\\n\\n“Yes, precisely.”\\n\\n“In the water?”\\n\\n“In the water.”\\n\\n“Ye gods, just give me a good harpoon! You see, sir, these sharks are\\nbadly designed. They have to roll their bellies over to snap you up,\\nand in the meantime . . .”\\n\\nNed Land had a way of pronouncing the word “snap” that sent chills\\ndown the spine.\\n\\n“Well, how about you, Conseil? What are your feelings about these\\nman-eaters?”\\n\\n“Me?” Conseil said. “I’m afraid I must be frank with master.”\\n\\nGood for you, I thought.\\n\\n“If master faces these sharks,” Conseil said, “I think his loyal\\nmanservant should face them with him!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nA Pearl Worth Ten Million\\n\\n\\nNIGHT FELL. I went to bed. I slept pretty poorly. Man-eaters played a\\nmajor role in my dreams. And I found it more or less appropriate that\\nthe French word for shark, requin, has its linguistic roots in the\\nword requiem.\\n\\nThe next day at four o’clock in the morning, I was awakened by the\\nsteward whom Captain Nemo had placed expressly at my service. I got up\\nquickly, dressed, and went into the lounge.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was waiting for me.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he said to me, “are you ready to start?”\\n\\n“I’m ready.”\\n\\n“Kindly follow me.”\\n\\n“What about my companions, captain?”\\n\\n“They’ve been alerted and are waiting for us.”\\n\\n“Aren’t we going to put on our diving suits?” I asked.\\n\\n“Not yet. I haven’t let the Nautilus pull too near the coast, and\\nwe’re fairly well out from the Mannar oysterbank. But I have the skiff\\nready, and it will take us to the exact spot where we’ll disembark,\\nwhich will save us a pretty long trek. It’s carrying our diving\\nequipment, and we’ll suit up just before we begin our underwater\\nexploring.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo took me to the central companionway whose steps led to\\nthe platform. Ned and Conseil were there, enraptured with the\\n“pleasure trip” getting under way. Oars in position, five of the\\nNautilus’s sailors were waiting for us aboard the skiff, which was\\nmoored alongside. The night was still dark. Layers of clouds cloaked\\nthe sky and left only a few stars in view. My eyes flew to the side\\nwhere land lay, but I saw only a blurred line covering three-quarters\\nof the horizon from southwest to northwest. Going up Ceylon’s west\\ncoast during the night, the Nautilus lay west of the bay, or rather\\nthat gulf formed by the mainland and Mannar Island. Under these dark\\nwaters there stretched the bank of shellfish, an inexhaustible field\\nof pearls more than twenty miles long.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo, Conseil, Ned Land, and I found seats in the stern of the\\nskiff. The longboat’s coxswain took the tiller; his four companions\\nleaned into their oars; the moorings were cast off and we pulled\\nclear.\\n\\nThe skiff headed southward. The oarsmen took their time. I watched\\ntheir strokes vigorously catch the water, and they always waited ten\\nseconds before rowing again, following the practice used in most\\nnavies. While the longboat coasted, drops of liquid flicked from the\\noars and hit the dark troughs of the waves, pitter-pattering like\\nsplashes of molten lead. Coming from well out, a mild swell made the\\nskiff roll gently, and a few cresting billows lapped at its bow.\\n\\nWe were silent. What was Captain Nemo thinking? Perhaps that this\\napproaching shore was too close for comfort, contrary to the\\nCanadian’s views in which it still seemed too far away. As for\\nConseil, he had come along out of simple curiosity.\\n\\nNear 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined the upper\\nlines of the coast with greater distinctness. Fairly flat to the east,\\nit swelled a little toward the south. Five miles still separated it\\nfrom us, and its beach merged with the misty waters. Between us and\\nthe shore, the sea was deserted. Not a boat, not a diver. Profound\\nsolitude reigned over this gathering place of pearl fishermen. As\\nCaptain Nemo had commented, we were arriving in these waterways a\\nmonth too soon.\\n\\nAt six o’clock the day broke suddenly, with that speed unique to\\ntropical regions, which experience no real dawn or dusk. The sun’s\\nrays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon, and\\nthe radiant orb rose swiftly.\\n\\nI could clearly see the shore, which featured a few sparse trees here\\nand there.\\n\\nThe skiff advanced toward Mannar Island, which curved to the\\nsouth. Captain Nemo stood up from his thwart and studied the sea.\\n\\nAt his signal the anchor was lowered, but its chain barely ran because\\nthe bottom lay no more than a meter down, and this locality was one of\\nthe shallowest spots near the bank of shellfish. Instantly the skiff\\nwheeled around under the ebb tide’s outbound thrust.\\n\\n“Here we are, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo then said. “You observe\\nthis confined bay? A month from now in this very place, the numerous\\nfishing boats of the harvesters will gather, and these are the waters\\ntheir divers will ransack so daringly. This bay is felicitously laid\\nout for their type of fishing. It’s sheltered from the strongest\\nwinds, and the sea is never very turbulent here, highly favorable\\nconditions for diving work. Now let’s put on our underwater suits, and\\nwe’ll begin our stroll.”\\n\\nI didn’t reply, and while staring at these suspicious waves, I began\\nto put on my heavy aquatic clothes, helped by the longboat’s\\nsailors. Captain Nemo and my two companions suited up as well. None of\\nthe Nautilus’s men were to go with us on this new excursion.\\n\\nSoon we were imprisoned up to the neck in india-rubber clothing, and\\nstraps fastened the air devices onto our backs. As for the Ruhmkorff\\ndevice, it didn’t seem to be in the picture. Before inserting my head\\ninto its copper capsule, I commented on this to the captain.\\n\\n“Our lighting equipment would be useless to us,” the captain answered\\nme. “We won’t be going very deep, and the sun’s rays will be\\nsufficient to light our way. Besides, it’s unwise to carry electric\\nlanterns under these waves. Their brightness might unexpectedly\\nattract certain dangerous occupants of these waterways.”\\n\\nAs Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and Ned\\nLand. But my two friends had already encased their craniums in their\\nmetal headgear, and they could neither hear nor reply.\\n\\nI had one question left to address to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“What about our weapons?” I asked him. “Our rifles?”\\n\\n“Rifles! What for? Don’t your mountaineers attack bears dagger in\\nhand? And isn’t steel surer than lead? Here’s a sturdy blade. Slip it\\nunder your belt and let’s be off.”\\n\\nI stared at my companions. They were armed in the same fashion, and\\nNed Land was also brandishing an enormous harpoon he had stowed in the\\nskiff before leaving the Nautilus.\\n\\nThen, following the captain’s example, I let myself be crowned with my\\nheavy copper sphere, and our air tanks immediately went into action.\\n\\nAn instant later, the longboat’s sailors helped us overboard one after\\nthe other, and we set foot on level sand in a meter and a half of\\nwater. Captain Nemo gave us a hand signal. We followed him down a\\ngentle slope and disappeared under the waves.\\n\\nThere the obsessive fears in my brain left me. I became surprisingly\\ncalm again. The ease with which I could move increased my confidence,\\nand the many strange sights captivated my imagination.\\n\\nThe sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves. The\\ntiniest objects remained visible. After ten minutes of walking, we\\nwere in five meters of water, and the terrain had become almost flat.\\n\\nLike a covey of snipe over a marsh, there rose underfoot schools of\\nunusual fish from the genus Monopterus, whose members have no fin but\\ntheir tail. I recognized the Javanese eel, a genuine eight-decimeter\\nserpent with a bluish gray belly, which, without the gold lines over\\nits flanks, could easily be confused with the conger eel. From the\\nbutterfish genus, whose oval bodies are very flat, I observed several\\nadorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal fin like a sickle,\\nedible fish that, when dried and marinated, make an excellent dish\\nknown by the name “karawade”; then some sea poachers, fish belonging\\nto the genus Aspidophoroides, whose bodies are covered with scaly\\narmor divided into eight lengthwise sections.\\n\\nMeanwhile, as the sun got progressively higher, it lit up the watery\\nmass more and more. The seafloor changed little by little. Its\\nfine-grained sand was followed by a genuine causeway of smooth crags\\ncovered by a carpet of mollusks and zoophytes. Among other specimens\\nin these two branches, I noted some windowpane oysters with thin\\nvalves of unequal size, a type of ostracod unique to the Red Sea and\\nthe Indian Ocean, then orange-hued lucina with circular shells,\\nawl-shaped auger shells, some of those Persian murex snails that\\nsupply the Nautilus with such wonderful dye, spiky periwinkles fifteen\\ncentimeters long that rose under the waves like hands ready to grab\\nyou, turban snails with shells made of horn and bristling all over\\nwith spines, lamp shells, edible duck clams that feed the Hindu\\nmarketplace, subtly luminous jellyfish of the species Pelagia\\npanopyra, and finally some wonderful Oculina flabelliforma,\\nmagnificent sea fans that fashion one of the most luxuriant tree forms\\nin this ocean.\\n\\nIn the midst of this moving vegetation, under arbors of water plants,\\nthere raced legions of clumsy articulates, in particular some fanged\\nfrog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle, robber\\ncrabs exclusive to these waterways, and horrible parthenope crabs\\nwhose appearance was repulsive to the eye. One animal no less hideous,\\nwhich I encountered several times, was the enormous crab that\\nMr. Darwin observed, to which nature has given the instinct and\\nrequisite strength to eat coconuts; it scrambles up trees on the beach\\nand sends the coconuts tumbling; they fracture in their fall and are\\nopened by its powerful pincers. Here, under these clear waves, this\\ncrab raced around with matchless agility, while green turtles from the\\nspecies frequenting the Malabar coast moved sluggishly among the\\ncrumbling rocks.\\n\\nNear seven o’clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish, where\\npearl oysters reproduce by the millions. These valuable mollusks stick\\nto rocks, where they’re strongly attached by a mass of brown filaments\\nthat forbids their moving about. In this respect oysters are inferior\\neven to mussels, to whom nature has not denied all talent for\\nlocomotion.\\n\\nThe shellfish Meleagrina, that womb for pearls whose valves are nearly\\nequal in size, has the shape of a round shell with thick walls and a\\nvery rough exterior. Some of these shells were furrowed with flaky,\\ngreenish bands that radiated down from the top. These were the young\\noysters. The others had rugged black surfaces, measured up to fifteen\\ncentimeters in width, and were ten or more years old.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo pointed to this prodigious heap of shellfish, and I saw\\nthat these mines were genuinely inexhaustible, since nature’s creative\\npowers are greater than man’s destructive instincts. True to those\\ninstincts, Ned Land greedily stuffed the finest of these mollusks into\\na net he carried at his side.\\n\\nBut we couldn’t stop. We had to follow the captain, who headed down\\ntrails seemingly known only to himself. The seafloor rose noticeably,\\nand when I lifted my arms, sometimes they would pass above the surface\\nof the sea. Then the level of the oysterbank would lower\\nunpredictably. Often we went around tall, pointed rocks rising like\\npyramids. In their dark crevices huge crustaceans, aiming their long\\nlegs like heavy artillery, watched us with unblinking eyes, while\\nunderfoot there crept millipedes, bloodworms, aricia worms, and\\nannelid worms, whose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly\\nlong.\\n\\nJust then a huge cave opened up in our path, hollowed from a\\npicturesque pile of rocks whose smooth heights were completely hung\\nwith underwater flora. At first this cave looked pitch-black to\\nme. Inside, the sun’s rays seemed to diminish by degrees. Their hazy\\ntransparency was nothing more than drowned light.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo went in. We followed him. My eyes soon grew accustomed to\\nthis comparative gloom. I distinguished the unpredictably contoured\\nspringings of a vault, supported by natural pillars firmly based on a\\ngranite foundation, like the weighty columns of Tuscan\\narchitecture. Why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the\\ndepths of this underwater crypt? I would soon find out.\\n\\nAfter going down a fairly steep slope, our feet trod the floor of a\\nsort of circular pit. There Captain Nemo stopped, and his hand\\nindicated an object that I hadn’t yet noticed.\\n\\nIt was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a titanic giant clam, a\\nholy-water font that could have held a whole lake, a basin more than\\ntwo meters wide, hence even bigger than the one adorning the\\nNautilus’s lounge.\\n\\nI approached this phenomenal mollusk. Its mass of filaments attached\\nit to a table of granite, and there it grew by itself in the midst of\\nthe cave’s calm waters. I estimated the weight of this giant clam at\\n300 kilograms. Hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat, and\\nyou’d need the stomach of King Gargantua to eat a couple dozen.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve’s\\nexistence. This wasn’t the first time he’d paid it a visit, and I\\nthought his sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show us\\na natural curiosity. I was mistaken. Captain Nemo had an explicit\\npersonal interest in checking on the current condition of this giant\\nclam.\\n\\nThe mollusk’s two valves were partly open. The captain approached and\\nstuck his dagger vertically between the shells to discourage any ideas\\nabout closing; then with his hands he raised the fringed,\\nmembrane-filled tunic that made up the animal’s mantle.\\n\\nThere, between its leaflike folds, I saw a loose pearl as big as a\\ncoconut. Its globular shape, perfect clarity, and wonderful orient\\nmade it a jewel of incalculable value. Carried away by curiosity, I\\nstretched out my hand to take it, weigh it, fondle it! But the captain\\nstopped me, signaled no, removed his dagger in one swift motion, and\\nlet the two valves snap shut.\\n\\nI then understood Captain Nemo’s intent. By leaving the pearl buried\\nbeneath the giant clam’s mantle, he allowed it to grow\\nimperceptibly. With each passing year the mollusk’s secretions added\\nnew concentric layers. The captain alone was familiar with the cave\\nwhere this wonderful fruit of nature was “ripening”; he alone reared\\nit, so to speak, in order to transfer it one day to his dearly beloved\\nmuseum. Perhaps, following the examples of oyster farmers in China and\\nIndia, he had even predetermined the creation of this pearl by\\nsticking under the mollusk’s folds some piece of glass or metal that\\nwas gradually covered with mother-of-pearl. In any case, comparing\\nthis pearl to others I already knew about, and to those shimmering in\\nthe captain’s collection, I estimated that it was worth at least\\n10,000,000 francs. It was a superb natural curiosity rather than a\\nluxurious piece of jewelry, because I don’t know of any female ear\\nthat could handle it.\\n\\nOur visit to this opulent giant clam came to an end. Captain Nemo left\\nthe cave, and we climbed back up the bank of shellfish in the midst of\\nthese clear waters not yet disturbed by divers at work.\\n\\nWe walked by ourselves, genuine loiterers stopping or straying as our\\nfancies dictated. For my part, I was no longer worried about those\\ndangers my imagination had so ridiculously exaggerated. The shallows\\ndrew noticeably closer to the surface of the sea, and soon, walking in\\nonly a meter of water, my head passed well above the level of the\\nocean. Conseil rejoined me, and gluing his huge copper capsule to\\nmine, his eyes gave me a friendly greeting. But this lofty plateau\\nmeasured only a few fathoms, and soon we reentered Our Element. I\\nthink I’ve now earned the right to dub it that.\\n\\nTen minutes later, Captain Nemo stopped suddenly. I thought he’d\\ncalled a halt so that we could turn and start back. No. With a gesture\\nhe ordered us to crouch beside him at the foot of a wide crevice. His\\nhand motioned toward a spot within the liquid mass, and I looked\\ncarefully.\\n\\nFive meters away a shadow appeared and dropped to the seafloor. The\\nalarming idea of sharks crossed my mind. But I was mistaken, and once\\nagain we didn’t have to deal with monsters of the deep.\\n\\nIt was a man, a living man, a black Indian fisherman, a poor devil who\\nno doubt had come to gather what he could before harvest time. I saw\\nthe bottom of his dinghy, moored a few feet above his head. He would\\ndive and go back up in quick succession. A stone cut in the shape of a\\nsugar loaf, which he gripped between his feet while a rope connected\\nit to his boat, served to lower him more quickly to the ocean\\nfloor. This was the extent of his equipment. Arriving on the seafloor\\nat a depth of about five meters, he fell to his knees and stuffed his\\nsack with shellfish gathered at random. Then he went back up, emptied\\nhis sack, pulled up his stone, and started all over again, the whole\\nprocess lasting only thirty seconds.\\n\\nThis diver didn’t see us. A shadow cast by our crag hid us from his\\nview. And besides, how could this poor Indian ever have guessed that\\nhuman beings, creatures like himself, were near him under the waters,\\neavesdropping on his movements, not missing a single detail of his\\nfishing!\\n\\nSo he went up and down several times. He gathered only about ten\\nshellfish per dive, because he had to tear them from the banks where\\neach clung with its tough mass of filaments. And how many of these\\noysters for which he risked his life would have no pearl in them!\\n\\nI observed him with great care. His movements were systematically\\nexecuted, and for half an hour no danger seemed to threaten him. So I\\nhad gotten used to the sight of this fascinating fishing when all at\\nonce, just as the Indian was kneeling on the seafloor, I saw him make\\na frightened gesture, stand, and gather himself to spring back to the\\nsurface of the waves.\\n\\nI understood his fear. A gigantic shadow appeared above the poor\\ndiver. It was a shark of huge size, moving in diagonally, eyes ablaze,\\njaws wide open!\\n\\nI was speechless with horror, unable to make a single movement.\\n\\nWith one vigorous stroke of its fins, the voracious animal shot toward\\nthe Indian, who jumped aside and avoided the shark’s bite but not the\\nthrashing of its tail, because that tail struck him across the chest\\nand stretched him out on the seafloor.\\n\\nThis scene lasted barely a few seconds. The shark returned, rolled\\nover on its back, and was getting ready to cut the Indian in half,\\nwhen Captain Nemo, who was stationed beside me, suddenly stood\\nup. Then he strode right toward the monster, dagger in hand, ready to\\nfight it at close quarters.\\n\\nJust as it was about to snap up the poor fisherman, the man-eater saw\\nits new adversary, repositioned itself on its belly, and headed\\nswiftly toward him.\\n\\nI can see Captain Nemo’s bearing to this day. Bracing himself, he\\nwaited for the fearsome man-eater with wonderful composure, and when\\nthe latter rushed at him, the captain leaped aside with prodigious\\nquickness, avoided a collision, and sank his dagger into its\\nbelly. But that wasn’t the end of the story. A dreadful battle was\\njoined.\\n\\nThe shark bellowed, so to speak. Blood was pouring into the waves from\\nits wounds. The sea was dyed red, and through this opaque liquid I\\ncould see nothing else.\\n\\nNothing else until the moment when, through a rift in the clouds, I\\nsaw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal’s fins, fighting\\nthe monster at close quarters, belaboring his enemy’s belly with stabs\\nof the dagger yet unable to deliver the deciding thrust, in other\\nwords, a direct hit to the heart. In its struggles the man-eater\\nchurned the watery mass so furiously, its eddies threatened to knock\\nme over.\\n\\nI wanted to run to the captain’s rescue. But I was transfixed with\\nhorror, unable to move.\\n\\nI stared, wild-eyed. I saw the fight enter a new phase. The captain\\nfell to the seafloor, toppled by the enormous mass weighing him\\ndown. Then the shark’s jaws opened astoundingly wide, like a pair of\\nindustrial shears, and that would have been the finish of Captain Nemo\\nhad not Ned Land, quick as thought, rushed forward with his harpoon\\nand driven its dreadful point into the shark’s underside.\\n\\nThe waves were saturated with masses of blood. The waters shook with\\nthe movements of the man-eater, which thrashed about with\\nindescribable fury. Ned Land hadn’t missed his target. This was the\\nmonster’s death rattle. Pierced to the heart, it was struggling with\\ndreadful spasms whose aftershocks knocked Conseil off his feet.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ned Land pulled the captain clear. Uninjured, the latter\\nstood up, went right to the Indian, quickly cut the rope binding the\\nman to his stone, took the fellow in his arms, and with a vigorous\\nkick of the heel, rose to the surface of the sea.\\n\\nThe three of us followed him, and a few moments later, miraculously\\nsafe, we reached the fisherman’s longboat.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo’s first concern was to revive this unfortunate man. I\\nwasn’t sure he would succeed. I hoped so, since the poor devil hadn’t\\nbeen under very long. But that stroke from the shark’s tail could have\\nbeen his deathblow.\\n\\nFortunately, after vigorous massaging by Conseil and the captain, I\\nsaw the nearly drowned man regain consciousness little by little. He\\nopened his eyes. How startled he must have felt, how frightened even,\\nat seeing four huge, copper craniums leaning over him!\\n\\nAnd above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo pulled a\\nbag of pearls from a pocket in his diving suit and placed it in the\\nfisherman’s hands? This magnificent benefaction from the Man of the\\nWaters to the poor Indian from Ceylon was accepted by the latter with\\ntrembling hands. His bewildered eyes indicated that he didn’t know to\\nwhat superhuman creatures he owed both his life and his fortune.\\n\\nAt the captain’s signal we returned to the bank of shellfish, and\\nretracing our steps, we walked for half an hour until we encountered\\nthe anchor connecting the seafloor with the Nautilus’s skiff.\\n\\nBack on board, the sailors helped divest us of our heavy copper\\ncarapaces.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo’s first words were spoken to the Canadian.\\n\\n“Thank you, Mr. Land,” he told him.\\n\\n“Tit for tat, captain,” Ned Land replied. “I owed it to you.”\\n\\nThe ghost of a smile glided across the captain’s lips, and that was\\nall.\\n\\n“To the Nautilus,” he said.\\n\\nThe longboat flew over the waves. A few minutes later we encountered\\nthe shark’s corpse again, floating.\\n\\nFrom the black markings on the tips of its fins, I recognized the\\ndreadful Squalus melanopterus from the seas of the East Indies, a\\nvariety in the species of sharks proper. It was more than twenty-five\\nfeet long; its enormous mouth occupied a third of its body. It was an\\nadult, as could be seen from the six rows of teeth forming an\\nisosceles triangle in its upper jaw.\\n\\nConseil looked at it with purely scientific fascination, and I’m sure\\nhe placed it, not without good reason, in the class of cartilaginous\\nfish, order Chondropterygia with fixed gills, family Selacia, genus\\nSqualus.\\n\\nWhile I was contemplating this inert mass, suddenly a dozen of these\\nvoracious melanoptera appeared around our longboat; but, paying no\\nattention to us, they pounced on the corpse and quarreled over every\\nscrap of it.\\n\\nBy 8:30 we were back on board the Nautilus.\\n\\nThere I fell to thinking about the incidents that marked our excursion\\nover the Mannar oysterbank. Two impressions inevitably stood out. One\\nconcerned Captain Nemo’s matchless bravery, the other his devotion to\\na human being, a representative of that race from which he had fled\\nbeneath the seas. In spite of everything, this strange man hadn’t yet\\nsucceeded in completely stifling his heart.\\n\\nWhen I shared these impressions with him, he answered me in a tone\\ntouched with emotion:\\n\\n“That Indian, professor, lives in the land of the oppressed, and I am\\nto this day, and will be until my last breath, a native of that same\\nland!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nThe Red Sea\\n\\n\\nDURING THE DAY of January 29, the island of Ceylon disappeared below\\nthe horizon, and at a speed of twenty miles per hour, the Nautilus\\nglided into the labyrinthine channels that separate the Maldive and\\nLaccadive Islands. It likewise hugged Kiltan Island, a shore of\\nmadreporic origin discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499 and one of\\nnineteen chief islands in the island group of the Laccadives, located\\nbetween latitude 10 degrees and 14 degrees 30’ north, and between\\nlongitude 50 degrees 72’ and 69 degrees east.\\n\\nBy then we had fared 16,220 miles, or 7,500 leagues, from our starting\\npoint in the seas of Japan.\\n\\nThe next day, January 30, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the\\nocean, there was no more land in sight. Setting its course to the\\nnorth-northwest, the ship headed toward the Gulf of Oman, carved out\\nbetween Arabia and the Indian peninsula and providing access to the\\nPersian Gulf.\\n\\nThis was obviously a blind alley with no possible outlet. So where was\\nCaptain Nemo taking us? I was unable to say. Which didn’t satisfy the\\nCanadian, who that day asked me where we were going.\\n\\n“We’re going, Mr. Ned, where the captain’s fancy takes us.”\\n\\n“His fancy,” the Canadian replied, “won’t take us very far. The\\nPersian Gulf has no outlet, and if we enter those waters, it won’t be\\nlong before we return in our tracks.”\\n\\n“All right, we’ll return, Mr. Land, and after the Persian Gulf, if the\\nNautilus wants to visit the Red Sea, the Strait of Bab el Mandeb is\\nstill there to let us in!”\\n\\n“I don’t have to tell you, sir,” Ned Land replied, “that the Red Sea\\nis just as landlocked as the gulf, since the Isthmus of Suez hasn’t\\nbeen cut all the way through yet; and even if it was, a boat as\\nsecretive as ours wouldn’t risk a canal intersected with locks. So the\\nRed Sea won’t be our way back to Europe either.”\\n\\n“But I didn’t say we’d return to Europe.”\\n\\n“What do you figure, then?”\\n\\n“I figure that after visiting these unusual waterways of Arabia and\\nEgypt, the Nautilus will go back down to the Indian Ocean, perhaps\\nthrough Mozambique Channel, perhaps off the Mascarene Islands, and\\nthen make for the Cape of Good Hope.”\\n\\n“And once we’re at the Cape of Good Hope?” the Canadian asked with\\ntypical persistence.\\n\\n“Well then, we’ll enter that Atlantic Ocean with which we aren’t yet\\nfamiliar. What’s wrong, Ned my friend? Are you tired of this voyage\\nunder the seas? Are you bored with the constantly changing sight of\\nthese underwater wonders? Speaking for myself, I’ll be extremely\\ndistressed to see the end of a voyage so few men will ever have a\\nchance to make.”\\n\\n“But don’t you realize, Professor Aronnax,” the Canadian replied,\\n“that soon we’ll have been imprisoned for three whole months aboard\\nthis Nautilus?”\\n\\n“No, Ned, I didn’t realize it, I don’t want to realize it, and I don’t\\nkeep track of every day and every hour.”\\n\\n“But when will it be over?”\\n\\n“In its appointed time. Meanwhile there’s nothing we can do about it,\\nand our discussions are futile. My gallant Ned, if you come and tell\\nme, ‘A chance to escape is available to us,’ then I’ll discuss it with\\nyou. But that isn’t the case, and in all honesty, I don’t think\\nCaptain Nemo ever ventures into European seas.”\\n\\nThis short dialogue reveals that in my mania for the Nautilus, I was\\nturning into the spitting image of its commander.\\n\\nAs for Ned Land, he ended our talk in his best speechifying style:\\n“That’s all fine and dandy. But in my humble opinion, a life in jail\\nis a life without joy.”\\n\\nFor four days until February 3, the Nautilus inspected the Gulf of\\nOman at various speeds and depths. It seemed to be traveling at\\nrandom, as if hesitating over which course to follow, but it never\\ncrossed the Tropic of Cancer.\\n\\nAfter leaving this gulf we raised Muscat for an instant, the most\\nimportant town in the country of Oman. I marveled at its strange\\nappearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it, against\\nwhich the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply. I spotted\\nthe rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant tips of its minarets,\\nand its fresh, leafy terraces. But it was only a fleeting vision, and\\nthe Nautilus soon sank beneath the dark waves of these waterways.\\n\\nThen our ship went along at a distance of six miles from the Arabic\\ncoasts of Mahra and Hadhramaut, their undulating lines of mountains\\nrelieved by a few ancient ruins. On February 5 we finally put into the\\nGulf of Aden, a genuine funnel stuck into the neck of Bab el Mandeb\\nand bottling these Indian waters in the Red Sea.\\n\\nOn February 6 the Nautilus cruised in sight of the city of Aden,\\nperched on a promontory connected to the continent by a narrow\\nisthmus, a sort of inaccessible Gibraltar whose fortifications the\\nEnglish rebuilt after capturing it in 1839. I glimpsed the octagonal\\nminarets of this town, which used to be one of the wealthiest, busiest\\ncommercial centers along this coast, as the Arab historian Idrisi\\ntells it.\\n\\nI was convinced that when Captain Nemo reached this point, he would\\nback out again; but I was mistaken, and much to my surprise, he did\\nnothing of the sort.\\n\\nThe next day, February 7, we entered the Strait of Bab el Mandeb,\\nwhose name means “Gate of Tears” in the Arabic language. Twenty miles\\nwide, it’s only fifty-two kilometers long, and with the Nautilus\\nlaunched at full speed, clearing it was the work of barely an\\nhour. But I didn’t see a thing, not even Perim Island where the\\nBritish government built fortifications to strengthen Aden’s\\nposition. There were many English and French steamers plowing this\\nnarrow passageway, liners going from Suez to Bombay, Calcutta,\\nMelbourne, RΘunion Island, and Mauritius; far too much traffic for the\\nNautilus to make an appearance on the surface. So it wisely stayed in\\nmidwater.\\n\\nFinally, at noon, we were plowing the waves of the Red Sea.\\n\\nThe Red Sea: that great lake so famous in biblical traditions, seldom\\nreplenished by rains, fed by no important rivers, continually drained\\nby a high rate of evaporation, its water level dropping a meter and a\\nhalf every year! If it were fully landlocked like a lake, this odd\\ngulf might dry up completely; on this score it’s inferior to its\\nneighbors, the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea, whose levels lower only\\nto the point where their evaporation exactly equals the amounts of\\nwater they take to their hearts.\\n\\nThis Red Sea is 2,600 kilometers long with an average width of 240. In\\nthe days of the\\n\\nPtolemies and the Roman emperors, it was a great commercial artery for\\nthe world, and when its isthmus has been cut through, it will\\ncompletely regain that bygone importance that the Suez railways have\\nalready brought back in part.\\n\\nI would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced Captain\\nNemo to take us into this gulf. But I wholeheartedly approved of the\\nNautilus’s entering it. It adopted a medium pace, sometimes staying on\\nthe surface, sometimes diving to avoid some ship, and so I could\\nobserve both the inside and topside of this highly unusual sea.\\n\\nOn February 8, as early as the first hours of daylight, Mocha appeared\\nbefore us: a town now in ruins, whose walls would collapse at the mere\\nsound of a cannon, and which shelters a few leafy date trees here and\\nthere. This once-important city used to contain six public\\nmarketplaces plus twenty-six mosques, and its walls, protected by\\nfourteen forts, fashioned a three-kilometer girdle around it.\\n\\nThen the Nautilus drew near the beaches of Africa, where the sea is\\nconsiderably deeper. There, through the open panels and in a midwater\\nof crystal clarity, our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes of\\nshining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green furs\\nof algae and fucus. What an indescribable sight, and what a variety of\\nsettings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic islands leveled\\noff by the Libyan coast! But soon the Nautilus hugged the eastern\\nshore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory. This was off\\nthe coast of Tihama, and there such zoophyte displays not only\\nflourished below sea level but they also fashioned picturesque\\nnetworks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it; the latter\\nwere more whimsical but less colorful than the former, which kept\\ntheir bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters.\\n\\nHow many delightful hours I spent in this way at the lounge window!\\nHow many new specimens of underwater flora and fauna I marveled at\\nbeneath the light of our electric beacon! Mushroom-shaped fungus\\ncoral, some slate-colored sea anemone including the species\\nThalassianthus aster among others, organ-pipe coral arranged like\\nflutes and just begging for a puff from the god Pan, shells unique to\\nthis sea that dwell in madreporic cavities and whose bases are twisted\\ninto squat spirals, and finally a thousand samples of a polypary I\\nhadn’t observed until then: the common sponge.\\n\\nFirst division in the polyp group, the class Spongiaria has been\\ncreated by scientists precisely for this unusual exhibit whose\\nusefulness is beyond dispute. The sponge is definitely not a plant, as\\nsome naturalists still believe, but an animal of the lowest order, a\\npolypary inferior even to coral. Its animal nature isn’t in doubt, and\\nwe can’t accept even the views of the ancients, who regarded it as\\nhalfway between plant and animal. But I must say that naturalists are\\nnot in agreement on the structural mode of sponges. For some it’s a\\npolypary, and for others, such as Professor Milne-Edwards, it’s a\\nsingle, solitary individual.\\n\\nThe class Spongiaria contains about 300 species that are encountered\\nin a large number of seas and even in certain streams, where they’ve\\nbeen given the name freshwater sponges. But their waters of choice are\\nthe Red Sea and the Mediterranean near the Greek Islands or the coast\\nof Syria. These waters witness the reproduction and growth of soft,\\ndelicate bath sponges whose prices run as high as 150 francs apiece:\\nthe yellow sponge from Syria, the horn sponge from Barbary, etc. But\\nsince I had no hope of studying these zoophytes in the seaports of the\\nLevant, from which we were separated by the insuperable Isthmus of\\nSuez, I had to be content with observing them in the waters of the Red\\nSea.\\n\\nSo I called Conseil to my side, while at an average depth of eight to\\nnine meters, the Nautilus slowly skimmed every beautiful rock on the\\neasterly coast.\\n\\nThere sponges grew in every shape, globular, stalklike, leaflike,\\nfingerlike. With reasonable accuracy, they lived up to their nicknames\\nof basket sponges, chalice sponges, distaff sponges, elkhorn sponges,\\nlion’s paws, peacock’s tails, and Neptune’s gloves—designations\\nbestowed on them by fishermen, more poetically inclined than\\nscientists. A gelatinous, semifluid substance coated the fibrous\\ntissue of these sponges, and from this tissue there escaped a steady\\ntrickle of water that, after carrying sustenance to each cell, was\\nbeing expelled by a contracting movement. This jellylike substance\\ndisappears when the polyp dies, emitting ammonia as it rots. Finally\\nnothing remains but the fibers, either gelatinous or made of horn,\\nthat constitute your household sponge, which takes on a russet hue and\\nis used for various tasks depending on its degree of elasticity,\\npermeability, or resistance to saturation.\\n\\nThese polyparies were sticking to rocks, shells of mollusks, and even\\nthe stalks of water plants. They adorned the smallest crevices, some\\nsprawling, others standing or hanging like coral outgrowths. I told\\nConseil that sponges are fished up in two ways, either by dragnet or\\nby hand. The latter method calls for the services of a diver, but it’s\\npreferable because it spares the polypary’s tissue, leaving it with a\\nmuch higher market value.\\n\\nOther zoophytes swarming near the sponges consisted chiefly of a very\\nelegant species of jellyfish; mollusks were represented by varieties\\nof squid that, according to Professor Orbigny, are unique to the Red\\nSea; and reptiles by virgata turtles belonging to the genus Chelonia,\\nwhich furnished our table with a dainty but wholesome dish.\\n\\nAs for fish, they were numerous and often remarkable. Here are the\\nones that the Nautilus’s nets most frequently hauled on board: rays,\\nincluding spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick red in color,\\ntheir bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and identifiable by\\ntheir jagged double stings, silver-backed skates, common stingrays\\nwith stippled tails, butterfly rays that looked like huge two-meter\\ncloaks flapping at middepth, toothless guitarfish that were a type of\\ncartilaginous fish closer to the shark, trunkfish known as dromedaries\\nthat were one and a half feet long and had humps ending in\\nbackward-curving stings, serpentine moray eels with silver tails and\\nbluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed in gray piping, a species of\\nbutterfish called the fiatola decked out in thin gold stripes and the\\nthree colors of the French flag, Montague blennies four decimeters\\nlong, superb jacks handsomely embellished by seven black crosswise\\nstreaks with blue and yellow fins plus gold and silver scales, snooks,\\nstandard mullet with yellow heads, parrotfish, wrasse, triggerfish,\\ngobies, etc., plus a thousand other fish common to the oceans we had\\nalready crossed.\\n\\nOn February 9 the Nautilus cruised in the widest part of the Red Sea,\\nmeasuring 190 miles straight across from Suakin on the west coast to\\nQunfidha on the east coast.\\n\\nAt noon that day after our position fix, Captain Nemo climbed onto the\\nplatform, where I happened to be. I vowed not to let him go below\\nagain without at least sounding him out on his future plans. As soon\\nas he saw me, he came over, graciously offered me a cigar, and said to\\nme:\\n\\n“Well, professor, are you pleased with this Red Sea? Have you seen\\nenough of its hidden wonders, its fish and zoophytes, its gardens of\\nsponges and forests of coral? Have you glimpsed the towns built on its\\nshores?”\\n\\n“Yes, Captain Nemo,” I replied, “and the Nautilus is wonderfully\\nsuited to this whole survey. Ah, it’s a clever boat!”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, clever, daring, and invulnerable! It fears neither the Red\\nSea’s dreadful storms nor its currents and reefs.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” I said, “this sea is mentioned as one of the worst, and in\\nthe days of the ancients, if I’m not mistaken, it had an abominable\\nreputation.”\\n\\n“Thoroughly abominable, Professor Aronnax. The Greek and Latin\\nhistorians can find nothing to say in its favor, and the Greek\\ngeographer Strabo adds that it’s especially rough during the rainy\\nseason and the period of summer prevailing winds. The Arab Idrisi,\\nreferring to it by the name Gulf of Colzoum, relates that ships\\nperished in large numbers on its sandbanks and that no one risked\\nnavigating it by night. This, he claims, is a sea subject to fearful\\nhurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and ‘with nothing good\\nto offer,’ either on its surface or in its depths. As a matter of\\nfact, the same views can also be found in Arrian, Agatharchides, and\\nArtemidorus.”\\n\\n“One can easily see,” I answered, “that those historians didn’t\\nnavigate aboard the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” the captain replied with a smile, “and in this respect, the\\nmoderns aren’t much farther along than the ancients. It took many\\ncenturies to discover the mechanical power of steam! Who knows whether\\nwe’ll see a second Nautilus within the next 100 years! Progress is\\nslow, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“It’s true,” I replied. “Your ship is a century ahead of its time,\\nperhaps several centuries. It would be most unfortunate if such a\\nsecret were to die with its inventor!”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo did not reply. After some minutes of silence:\\n\\n“We were discussing,” he said, “the views of ancient historians on the\\ndangers of navigating this Red Sea?”\\n\\n“True,” I replied. “But weren’t their fears exaggerated?”\\n\\n“Yes and no, Professor Aronnax,” answered Captain Nemo, who seemed to\\nknow “his Red Sea” by heart. “To a modern ship, well rigged, solidly\\nconstructed, and in control of its course thanks to obedient steam,\\nsome conditions are no longer hazardous that offered all sorts of\\ndangers to the vessels of the ancients. Picture those early navigators\\nventuring forth in sailboats built from planks lashed together with\\npalm-tree ropes, caulked with powdered resin, and coated with dogfish\\ngrease. They didn’t even have instruments for taking their bearings,\\nthey went by guesswork in the midst of currents they barely\\nknew. Under such conditions, shipwrecks had to be numerous. But\\nnowadays steamers providing service between Suez and the South Seas\\nhave nothing to fear from the fury of this gulf, despite the contrary\\nwinds of its monsoons. Their captains and passengers no longer prepare\\nfor departure with sacrifices to placate the gods, and after\\nreturning, they don’t traipse in wreaths and gold ribbons to say\\nthanks at the local temple.”\\n\\n“Agreed,” I said. “And steam seems to have killed off all gratitude in\\nseamen’s hearts. But since you seem to have made a special study of\\nthis sea, captain, can you tell me how it got its name?”\\n\\n“Many explanations exist on the subject, Professor Aronnax. Would you\\nlike to hear the views of one chronicler in the 14th century?”\\n\\n“Gladly.”\\n\\n“This fanciful fellow claims the sea was given its name after the\\ncrossing of the Israelites, when the Pharaoh perished in those waves\\nthat came together again at Moses’ command:\\n\\nTo mark that miraculous sequel, the sea turned a red without equal.\\n\\nThus no other course would do but to name it for its hue.”\\n\\n“An artistic explanation, Captain Nemo,” I replied, “but I’m unable to\\nrest content with it. So I’ll ask you for your own personal views.”\\n\\n“Here they come. To my thinking, Professor Aronnax, this ‘Red Sea’\\ndesignation must be regarded as a translation of the Hebrew word\\n‘Edrom,’ and if the ancients gave it that name, it was because of the\\nunique color of its waters.”\\n\\n“Until now, however, I’ve seen only clear waves, without any unique\\nhue.”\\n\\n“Surely, but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf, you’ll note\\nits odd appearance. I recall seeing the bay of El Tur completely red,\\nlike a lake of blood.”\\n\\n“And you attribute this color to the presence of microscopic algae?”\\n\\n“Yes. It’s a purplish, mucilaginous substance produced by those tiny\\nbuds known by the name trichodesmia, 40,000 of which are needed to\\noccupy the space of one square millimeter. Perhaps you’ll encounter\\nthem when we reach El Tur.”\\n\\n“Hence, Captain Nemo, this isn’t the first time you’ve gone through\\nthe Red Sea aboard the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“No, sir.”\\n\\n“Then, since you’ve already mentioned the crossing of the Israelites\\nand the catastrophe that befell the Egyptians, I would ask if you’ve\\never discovered any traces under the waters of that great historic\\nevent?”\\n\\n“No, professor, and for an excellent reason.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“It’s because that same locality where Moses crossed with all his\\npeople is now so clogged with sand, camels can barely get their legs\\nwet. You can understand that my Nautilus wouldn’t have enough water\\nfor itself.”\\n\\n“And that locality is . . . ?” I asked.\\n\\n“That locality lies a little above Suez in a sound that used to form a\\ndeep estuary when the Red Sea stretched as far as the Bitter\\nLakes. Now, whether or not their crossing was literally miraculous,\\nthe Israelites did cross there in returning to the Promised Land, and\\nthe Pharaoh’s army did perish at precisely that locality. So I think\\nthat excavating those sands would bring to light a great many weapons\\nand tools of Egyptian origin.”\\n\\n“Obviously,” I replied. “And for the sake of archaeology, let’s hope\\nthat sooner or later such excavations do take place, once new towns\\nare settled on the isthmus after the Suez Canal has been cut through—a\\ncanal, by the way, of little use to a ship such as the Nautilus!”\\n\\n“Surely, but of great use to the world at large,” Captain Nemo\\nsaid. “The ancients well understood the usefulness to commerce of\\nconnecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, but they never dreamed\\nof cutting a canal between the two, and instead they picked the Nile\\nas their link. If we can trust tradition, it was probably Egypt’s King\\nSesostris who started digging the canal needed to join the Nile with\\nthe Red Sea. What’s certain is that in 615 B.C. King Necho II was hard\\nat work on a canal that was fed by Nile water and ran through the\\nEgyptian plains opposite Arabia. This canal could be traveled in four\\ndays, and it was so wide, two triple-tiered galleys could pass through\\nit abreast. Its construction was continued by Darius the Great, son of\\nHystaspes, and probably completed by King Ptolemy II. Strabo saw it\\nused for shipping; but the weakness of its slope between its starting\\npoint, near Bubastis, and the Red Sea left it navigable only a few\\nmonths out of the year. This canal served commerce until the century\\nof Rome’s Antonine emperors; it was then abandoned and covered with\\nsand, subsequently reinstated by Arabia’s Caliph Omar I, and finally\\nfilled in for good in 761 or 762 A.D. by Caliph Al-Mansur, in an\\neffort to prevent supplies from reaching Mohammed ibn Abdullah, who\\nhad rebelled against him. During his Egyptian campaign, your General\\nNapoleon Bonaparte discovered traces of this old canal in the Suez\\ndesert, and when the tide caught him by surprise, he wellnigh perished\\njust a few hours before rejoining his regiment at Hadjaroth, the very\\nplace where Moses had pitched camp 3,300 years before him.”\\n\\n“Well, captain, what the ancients hesitated to undertake, Mr. de\\nLesseps is now finishing up; his joining of these two seas will\\nshorten the route from Cadiz to the East Indies by 9,000 kilometers,\\nand he’ll soon change Africa into an immense island.”\\n\\n“Yes, Professor Aronnax, and you have every right to be proud of your\\nfellow countryman. Such a man brings a nation more honor than the\\ngreatest commanders! Like so many others, he began with difficulties\\nand setbacks, but he triumphed because he has the volunteer\\nspirit. And it’s sad to think that this deed, which should have been\\nan international deed, which would have insured that any\\nadministration went down in history, will succeed only through the\\nefforts of one man. So all hail to Mr. de Lesseps!”\\n\\n“Yes, all hail to that great French citizen,” I replied, quite\\nstartled by how emphatically Captain Nemo had just spoken.\\n\\n“Unfortunately,” he went on, “I can’t take you through that Suez\\nCanal, but the day after tomorrow, you’ll be able to see the long\\njetties of Port Said when we’re in the Mediterranean.”\\n\\n“In the Mediterranean!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, professor. Does that amaze you?”\\n\\n“What amazes me is thinking we’ll be there the day after tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Oh really?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain, although since I’ve been aboard your vessel, I should\\nhave formed the habit of not being amazed by anything!”\\n\\n“But what is it that startles you?”\\n\\n“The thought of how hideously fast the Nautilus will need to go, if\\nit’s to double the Cape of Good Hope, circle around Africa, and lie in\\nthe open Mediterranean by the day after tomorrow.”\\n\\n“And who says it will circle Africa, professor? What’s this talk about\\ndoubling the Cape of Good Hope?”\\n\\n“But unless the Nautilus navigates on dry land and crosses over the\\nisthmus—”\\n\\n“Or under it, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“Under it?”\\n\\n“Surely,” Captain Nemo replied serenely. “Under that tongue of land,\\nnature long ago made what man today is making on its surface.”\\n\\n“What! There’s a passageway?”\\n\\n“Yes, an underground passageway that I’ve named the Arabian Tunnel. It\\nstarts below Suez and leads to the Bay of Pelusium.”\\n\\n“But isn’t that isthmus only composed of quicksand?”\\n\\n“To a certain depth. But at merely fifty meters, one encounters a firm\\nfoundation of rock.”\\n\\n“And it’s by luck that you discovered this passageway?” I asked, more\\nand more startled.\\n\\n“Luck plus logic, professor, and logic even more than luck.”\\n\\n“Captain, I hear you, but I can’t believe my ears.”\\n\\n“Oh, sir! The old saying still holds good: Aures habent et non\\naudient!* Not only does this passageway exist, but I’ve taken\\nadvantage of it on several occasions. Without it, I wouldn’t have\\nventured today into such a blind alley as the Red Sea.”\\n\\n*Latin: “They have ears but hear not.” Ed.\\n\\n“Is it indiscreet to ask how you discovered this tunnel?”\\n\\n“Sir,” the captain answered me, “there can be no secrets between men\\nwho will never leave each other.”\\n\\nI ignored this innuendo and waited for Captain Nemo’s explanation.\\n\\n“Professor,” he told me, “the simple logic of the naturalist led me to\\ndiscover this passageway, and I alone am familiar with it. I’d noted\\nthat in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean there exist a number of\\nabsolutely identical species of fish: eels, butterfish, greenfish,\\nbass, jewelfish, flying fish. Certain of this fact, I wondered if\\nthere weren’t a connection between the two seas. If there were, its\\nunderground current had to go from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean\\nsimply because of their difference in level. So I caught a large\\nnumber of fish in the vicinity of Suez. I slipped copper rings around\\ntheir tails and tossed them back into the sea. A few months later off\\nthe coast of Syria, I recaptured a few specimens of my fish, adorned\\nwith their telltale rings. So this proved to me that some connection\\nexisted between the two seas. I searched for it with my Nautilus, I\\ndiscovered it, I ventured into it; and soon, professor, you also will\\nhave cleared my Arabic tunnel!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nArabian Tunnel\\n\\n\\nTHE SAME DAY, I reported to Conseil and Ned Land that part of the\\nforegoing conversation directly concerning them. When I told them we\\nwould be lying in Mediterranean waters within two days, Conseil\\nclapped his hands, but the Canadian shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n“An underwater tunnel!” he exclaimed. “A connection between two seas!\\nWho ever heard of such malarkey!”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” Conseil replied, “had you ever heard of the Nautilus?\\nNo, yet here it is! So don’t shrug your shoulders so blithely, and\\ndon’t discount something with the feeble excuse that you’ve never\\nheard of it.”\\n\\n“We’ll soon see!” Ned Land shot back, shaking his head. “After all,\\nI’d like nothing better than to believe in your captain’s little\\npassageway, and may Heaven grant it really does take us to the\\nMediterranean.”\\n\\nThe same evening, at latitude 21 degrees 30’ north, the Nautilus was\\nafloat on the surface of the sea and drawing nearer to the Arab\\ncoast. I spotted Jidda, an important financial center for Egypt,\\nSyria, Turkey, and the East Indies. I could distinguish with\\nreasonable clarity the overall effect of its buildings, the ships made\\nfast along its wharves, and those bigger vessels whose draft of water\\nrequired them to drop anchor at the port’s offshore mooring. The sun,\\nfairly low on the horizon, struck full force on the houses in this\\ntown, accenting their whiteness. Outside the city limits, some wood or\\nreed huts indicated the quarter where the bedouins lived.\\n\\nSoon Jidda faded into the shadows of evening, and the Nautilus went\\nback beneath the mildly phosphorescent waters.\\n\\nThe next day, February 10, several ships appeared, running on our\\nopposite tack. The Nautilus resumed its underwater navigating; but at\\nthe moment of our noon sights, the sea was deserted and the ship rose\\nagain to its waterline.\\n\\nWith Ned and Conseil, I went to sit on the platform. The coast to the\\neast looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog.\\n\\nLeaning against the sides of the skiff, we were chatting of one thing\\nand another, when Ned Land stretched his hand toward a point in the\\nwater, saying to me:\\n\\n“See anything out there, professor?”\\n\\n“No, Ned,” I replied, “but you know I don’t have your eyes.”\\n\\n“Take a good look,” Ned went on. “There, ahead to starboard, almost\\nlevel with the beacon! Don’t you see a mass that seems to be moving\\naround?”\\n\\n“Right,” I said after observing carefully, “I can make out something\\nlike a long, blackish object on the surface of the water.”\\n\\n“A second Nautilus?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“No,” the Canadian replied, “unless I’m badly mistaken, that’s some\\nmarine animal.”\\n\\n“Are there whales in the Red Sea?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” I replied, “they’re sometimes found here.”\\n\\n“That’s no whale,” continued Ned Land, whose eyes never strayed from\\nthe object they had sighted. “We’re old chums, whales and I, and I\\ncouldn’t mistake their little ways.”\\n\\n“Let’s wait and see,” Conseil said. “The Nautilus is heading that\\ndirection, and we’ll soon know what we’re in for.”\\n\\nIn fact, that blackish object was soon only a mile away from us. It\\nlooked like a huge reef stranded in midocean. What was it? I still\\ncouldn’t make up my mind.\\n\\n“Oh, it’s moving off! It’s diving!” Ned Land exclaimed. “Damnation!\\nWhat can that animal be? It doesn’t have a forked tail like baleen\\nwhales or sperm whales, and its fins look like sawed-off limbs.”\\n\\n“But in that case—” I put in.\\n\\n“Good lord,” the Canadian went on, “it’s rolled over on its back, and\\nit’s raising its breasts in the air!”\\n\\n“It’s a siren!” Conseil exclaimed. “With all due respect to master,\\nit’s an actual mermaid!”\\n\\nThat word “siren” put me back on track, and I realized that the animal\\nbelonged to the order Sirenia: marine creatures that legends have\\nturned into mermaids, half woman, half fish.\\n\\n“No,” I told Conseil, “that’s no mermaid, it’s an unusual creature of\\nwhich only a few specimens are left in the Red Sea. That’s a dugong.”\\n\\n“Order Sirenia, group Pisciforma, subclass Monodelphia, class\\nMammalia, branch Vertebrata,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nAnd when Conseil has spoken, there’s nothing else to be said.\\n\\nMeanwhile Ned Land kept staring. His eyes were gleaming with desire at\\nthe sight of that animal. His hands were ready to hurl a harpoon. You\\nwould have thought he was waiting for the right moment to jump\\noverboard and attack the creature in its own element.\\n\\n“Oh, sir,” he told me in a voice trembling with excitement, “I’ve\\nnever killed anything like that!”\\n\\nHis whole being was concentrated in this last word.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo appeared on the platform. He spotted the\\ndugong. He understood the Canadian’s frame of mind and addressed him\\ndirectly:\\n\\n“If you held a harpoon, Mr. Land, wouldn’t your hands be itching to\\nput it to work?”\\n\\n“Positively, sir.”\\n\\n“And just for one day, would it displease you to return to your\\nfisherman’s trade and add this cetacean to the list of those you’ve\\nalready hunted down?”\\n\\n“It wouldn’t displease me one bit.”\\n\\n“All right, you can try your luck!”\\n\\n“Thank you, sir,” Ned Land replied, his eyes ablaze.\\n\\n“Only,” the captain went on, “I urge you to aim carefully at this\\nanimal, in your own personal interest.”\\n\\n“Is the dugong dangerous to attack?” I asked, despite the Canadian’s\\nshrug of the shoulders.\\n\\n“Yes, sometimes,” the captain replied. “These animals have been known\\nto turn on their assailants and capsize their longboats. But with\\nMr. Land that danger isn’t to be feared. His eye is sharp, his arm is\\nsure. If I recommend that he aim carefully at this dugong, it’s\\nbecause the animal is justly regarded as fine game, and I know\\nMr. Land doesn’t despise a choice morsel.”\\n\\n“Aha!” the Canadian put in. “This beast offers the added luxury of\\nbeing good to eat?”\\n\\n“Yes, Mr. Land. Its flesh is actual red meat, highly prized, and set\\naside throughout Malaysia for the tables of aristocrats. Accordingly,\\nthis excellent animal has been hunted so bloodthirstily that, like its\\nmanatee relatives, it has become more and more scarce.”\\n\\n“In that case, captain,” Conseil said in all seriousness, “on the\\noffchance that this creature might be the last of its line, wouldn’t\\nit be advisable to spare its life, in the interests of science?”\\n\\n“Maybe,” the Canadian answered, “it would be better to hunt it down,\\nin the interests of mealtime.”\\n\\n“Then proceed, Mr. Land,” Captain Nemo replied.\\n\\nJust then, as mute and emotionless as ever, seven crewmen climbed onto\\nthe platform. One carried a harpoon and line similar to those used in\\nwhale fishing. Its deck paneling opened, the skiff was wrenched from\\nits socket and launched to sea. Six rowers sat on the thwarts, and the\\ncoxswain took the tiller. Ned, Conseil, and I found seats in the\\nstern.\\n\\n“Aren’t you coming, captain?” I asked.\\n\\n“No, sir, but I wish you happy hunting.”\\n\\nThe skiff pulled clear, and carried off by its six oars, it headed\\nswiftly toward the dugong, which by then was floating two miles from\\nthe Nautilus.\\n\\nArriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean, our longboat\\nslowed down, and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil\\nwaters. Harpoon in hand, Ned Land went to take his stand in the\\nskiff’s bow. Harpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to\\na very long rope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags\\nit with him. But this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms,\\nand its end had simply been fastened to a small barrel that, while\\nfloating, would indicate the dugong’s movements beneath the waters.\\n\\nI stood up and could clearly observe the Canadian’s adversary. This\\ndugong—which also boasts the name halicore—closely resembled a\\nmanatee. Its oblong body ended in a very long caudal fin and its\\nlateral fins in actual fingers. It differs from the manatee in that\\nits upper jaw is armed with two long, pointed teeth that form\\ndiverging tusks on either side.\\n\\nThis dugong that Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal\\ndimensions, easily exceeding seven meters in length. It didn’t stir\\nand seemed to be sleeping on the surface of the waves, a circumstance\\nthat should have made it easier to capture.\\n\\nThe skiff approached cautiously to within three fathoms of the\\nanimal. The oars hung suspended above their rowlocks. I was\\ncrouching. His body leaning slightly back, Ned Land brandished his\\nharpoon with expert hands.\\n\\nSuddenly a hissing sound was audible, and the dugong\\ndisappeared. Although the harpoon had been forcefully hurled, it\\napparently had hit only water.\\n\\n“Damnation!” exclaimed the furious Canadian. “I missed it!”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “the animal’s wounded, there’s its blood; but your\\nweapon didn’t stick in its body.”\\n\\n“My harpoon! Get my harpoon!” Ned Land exclaimed.\\n\\nThe sailors went back to their sculling, and the coxswain steered the\\nlongboat toward the floating barrel. We fished up the harpoon, and the\\nskiff started off in pursuit of the animal.\\n\\nThe latter returned from time to time to breathe at the surface of the\\nsea. Its wound hadn’t weakened it because it went with tremendous\\nspeed. Driven by energetic arms, the longboat flew on its\\ntrail. Several times we got within a few fathoms of it, and the\\nCanadian hovered in readiness to strike; but then the dugong would\\nsteal away with a sudden dive, and it proved impossible to overtake\\nthe beast.\\n\\nI’ll let you assess the degree of anger consuming our impatient Ned\\nLand. He hurled at the hapless animal the most potent swearwords in\\nthe English language. For my part, I was simply distressed to see this\\ndugong outwit our every scheme.\\n\\nWe chased it unflaggingly for a full hour, and I’d begun to think it\\nwould prove too difficult to capture, when the animal got the untimely\\nidea of taking revenge on us, a notion it would soon have cause to\\nregret. It wheeled on the skiff, to assault us in its turn.\\n\\nThis maneuver did not escape the Canadian.\\n\\n“Watch out!” he said.\\n\\nThe coxswain pronounced a few words in his bizarre language, and no\\ndoubt he alerted his men to keep on their guard.\\n\\nArriving within twenty feet of the skiff, the dugong stopped, sharply\\nsniffing the air with its huge nostrils, pierced not at the tip of its\\nmuzzle but on its topside. Then it gathered itself and sprang at us.\\n\\nThe skiff couldn’t avoid the collision. Half overturned, it shipped a\\nton or two of water that we had to bail out. But thanks to our\\nskillful coxswain, we were fouled on the bias rather than broadside,\\nso we didn’t capsize. Clinging to the stempost, Ned Land thrust his\\nharpoon again and again into the gigantic animal, which imbedded its\\nteeth in our gunwale and lifted the longboat out of the water as a\\nlion would lift a deer. We were thrown on top of each other, and I\\nhave no idea how the venture would have ended had not the Canadian,\\nstill thirsting for the beast’s blood, finally pierced it to the\\nheart.\\n\\nI heard its teeth grind on sheet iron, and the dugong disappeared,\\ntaking our harpoon along with it. But the barrel soon popped up on the\\nsurface, and a few moments later the animal’s body appeared and rolled\\nover on its back. Our skiff rejoined it, took it in tow, and headed to\\nthe Nautilus.\\n\\nIt took pulleys of great strength to hoist this dugong onto the\\nplatform. The beast weighed 5,000 kilograms. It was carved up in sight\\nof the Canadian, who remained to watch every detail of the\\noperation. At dinner the same day, my steward served me some slices of\\nthis flesh, skillfully dressed by the ship’s cook. I found it\\nexcellent, even better than veal if not beef.\\n\\nThe next morning, February 11, the Nautilus’s pantry was enriched by\\nmore dainty game. A covey of terns alighted on the Nautilus. They were\\na species of Sterna nilotica unique to Egypt: beak black, head gray\\nand stippled, eyes surrounded by white dots, back, wings, and tail\\ngrayish, belly and throat white, feet red. Also caught were a couple\\ndozen Nile duck, superior-tasting wildfowl whose neck and crown of the\\nhead are white speckled with black.\\n\\nBy then the Nautilus had reduced speed. It moved ahead at a saunter,\\nso to speak. I observed that the Red Sea’s water was becoming less\\nsalty the closer we got to Suez.\\n\\nNear five o’clock in the afternoon, we sighted Cape Ras Mohammed to\\nthe north. This cape forms the tip of Arabia Petraea, which lies\\nbetween the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba.\\n\\nThe Nautilus entered the Strait of Jubal, which leads to the Gulf of\\nSuez. I could clearly make out a high mountain crowning Ras Mohammed\\nbetween the two gulfs. It was Mt. Horeb, that biblical Mt. Sinai on\\nwhose summit Moses met God face to face, that summit the mind’s eye\\nalways pictures as wreathed in lightning.\\n\\nAt six o’clock, sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged, the Nautilus\\npassed well out from El Tur, which sat at the far end of a bay whose\\nwaters seemed to be dyed red, as Captain Nemo had already\\nmentioned. Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence\\noccasionally broken by the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds, by\\nthe sound of surf chafing against rocks, or by the distant moan of a\\nsteamer churning the waves of the gulf with noisy blades.\\n\\nFrom eight to nine o’clock, the Nautilus stayed a few meters beneath\\nthe waters. According to my calculations, we had to be quite close to\\nSuez. Through the panels in the lounge, I spotted rocky bottoms\\nbrightly lit by our electric rays. It seemed to me that the strait was\\ngetting narrower and narrower.\\n\\nAt 9:15 when our boat returned to the surface, I climbed onto the\\nplatform. I was quite impatient to clear Captain Nemo’s tunnel,\\ncouldn’t sit still, and wanted to breathe the fresh night air.\\n\\nSoon, in the shadows, I spotted a pale signal light glimmering a mile\\naway, half discolored by mist.\\n\\n“A floating lighthouse,” said someone next to me.\\n\\nI turned and discovered the captain.\\n\\n“That’s the floating signal light of Suez,” he went on. “It won’t be\\nlong before we reach the entrance to the tunnel.”\\n\\n“It can’t be very easy to enter it.”\\n\\n“No, sir. Accordingly, I’m in the habit of staying in the pilothouse\\nand directing maneuvers myself. And now if you’ll kindly go below,\\nProfessor Aronnax, the Nautilus is about to sink beneath the waves,\\nand it will only return to the surface after we’ve cleared the Arabian\\nTunnel.”\\n\\nI followed Captain Nemo. The hatch closed, the ballast tanks filled\\nwith water, and the submersible sank some ten meters down.\\n\\nJust as I was about to repair to my stateroom, the captain stopped me.\\n\\n“Professor,” he said to me, “would you like to go with me to the\\nwheelhouse?”\\n\\n“I was afraid to ask,” I replied.\\n\\n“Come along, then. This way, you’ll learn the full story about this\\ncombination underwater and underground navigating.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo led me to the central companionway. In midstair he opened\\na door, went along the upper gangways, and arrived at the wheelhouse,\\nwhich, as you know, stands at one end of the platform.\\n\\nIt was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling those\\noccupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the Mississippi or Hudson\\nrivers. In the center stood an upright wheel geared to rudder cables\\nrunning to the Nautilus’s stern. Set in the cabin’s walls were four\\ndeadlights, windows of biconvex glass that enabled the man at the helm\\nto see in every direction.\\n\\nThe cabin was dark; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness\\nand I saw the pilot, a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs of\\nthe wheel. Outside, the sea was brightly lit by the beacon shining\\nbehind the cabin at the other end of the platform.\\n\\n“Now,” Captain Nemo said, “let’s look for our passageway.”\\n\\nElectric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room, and from\\nthis cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading and speed\\nto his Nautilus. He pressed a metal button and at once the propeller\\nslowed down significantly.\\n\\nI stared in silence at the high, sheer wall we were skirting just\\nthen, the firm base of the sandy mountains on the coast. For an hour\\nwe went along it in this fashion, staying only a few meters\\naway. Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the two concentric circles\\nof the compass hanging in the cabin. At a mere gesture from him, the\\nhelmsman would instantly change the Nautilus’s heading.\\n\\nStanding by the port deadlight, I spotted magnificent coral\\nsubstructures, zoophytes, algae, and crustaceans with enormous\\nquivering claws that stretched forth from crevices in the rock.\\n\\nAt 10:15 Captain Nemo himself took the helm. Dark and deep, a wide\\ngallery opened ahead of us. The Nautilus was brazenly swallowed\\nup. Strange rumblings were audible along our sides. It was the water\\nof the Red Sea, hurled toward the Mediterranean by the tunnel’s\\nslope. Our engines tried to offer resistance by churning the waves\\nwith propeller in reverse, but the Nautilus went with the torrent, as\\nswift as an arrow.\\n\\nAlong the narrow walls of this passageway, I saw only brilliant\\nstreaks, hard lines, fiery furrows, all scrawled by our speeding\\nelectric light. With my hand I tried to curb the pounding of my heart.\\n\\nAt 10:35 Captain Nemo left the steering wheel and turned to me:\\n\\n“The Mediterranean,” he told me.\\n\\nIn less than twenty minutes, swept along by the torrent, the Nautilus\\nhad just cleared the Isthmus of Suez.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nThe Greek Islands\\n\\n\\nAT SUNRISE the next morning, February 12, the Nautilus rose to the\\nsurface of the waves.\\n\\nI rushed onto the platform. The hazy silhouette of Pelusium was\\noutlined three miles to the south. A torrent had carried us from one\\nsea to the other. But although that tunnel was easy to descend, going\\nback up must have been impossible.\\n\\nNear seven o’clock Ned and Conseil joined me. Those two inseparable\\ncompanions had slept serenely, utterly unaware of the Nautilus’s feat.\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Naturalist,” the Canadian asked in a gently mocking tone,\\n“and how about that Mediterranean?”\\n\\n“We’re floating on its surface, Ned my friend.”\\n\\n“What!” Conseil put in. “Last night . . . ?”\\n\\n“Yes, last night, in a matter of minutes, we cleared that insuperable\\nisthmus.”\\n\\n“I don’t believe a word of it,” the Canadian replied.\\n\\n“And you’re in the wrong, Mr. Land,” I went on. “That flat coastline\\ncurving southward is the coast of Egypt.”\\n\\n“Tell it to the marines, sir,” answered the stubborn Canadian.\\n\\n“But if master says so,” Conseil told him, “then so be it.”\\n\\n“What’s more, Ned,” I said, “Captain Nemo himself did the honors in\\nhis tunnel, and I stood beside him in the pilothouse while he steered\\nthe Nautilus through that narrow passageway.”\\n\\n“You hear, Ned?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“And you, Ned, who have such good eyes,” I added, “you can spot the\\njetties of Port Said stretching out to sea.”\\n\\nThe Canadian looked carefully.\\n\\n“Correct,” he said. “You’re right, professor, and your captain’s a\\nsuperman. We’re in the Mediterranean. Fine. So now let’s have a chat\\nabout our little doings, if you please, but in such a way that nobody\\noverhears.”\\n\\nI could easily see what the Canadian was driving at. In any event, I\\nthought it best to let him have his chat, and we all three went to sit\\nnext to the beacon, where we were less exposed to the damp spray from\\nthe billows.\\n\\n“Now, Ned, we’re all ears,” I said. “What have you to tell us?”\\n\\n“What I’ve got to tell you is very simple,” the Canadian\\nreplied. “We’re in Europe, and before Captain Nemo’s whims take us\\ndeep into the polar seas or back to Oceania, I say we should leave\\nthis Nautilus.”\\n\\nI confess that such discussions with the Canadian always baffled me. I\\ndidn’t want to restrict my companions’ freedom in any way, and yet I\\nhad no desire to leave Captain Nemo. Thanks to him and his\\nsubmersible, I was finishing my undersea research by the day, and I\\nwas rewriting my book on the great ocean depths in the midst of its\\nvery element. Would I ever again have such an opportunity to observe\\nthe ocean’s wonders? Absolutely not! So I couldn’t entertain this idea\\nof leaving the Nautilus before completing our course of inquiry.\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I said, “answer me honestly. Are you bored with this\\nship? Are you sorry that fate has cast you into Captain Nemo’s hands?”\\n\\nThe Canadian paused for a short while before replying. Then, crossing\\nhis arms:\\n\\n“Honestly,” he said, “I’m not sorry about this voyage under the\\nseas. I’ll be glad to have done it, but in order to have done it, it\\nhas to finish. That’s my feeling.”\\n\\n“It will finish, Ned.”\\n\\n“Where and when?”\\n\\n“Where? I don’t know. When? I can’t say. Or, rather, I suppose it will\\nbe over when these seas have nothing more to teach us. Everything that\\nbegins in this world must inevitably come to an end.”\\n\\n“I think as master does,” Conseil replied, “and it’s extremely\\npossible that after crossing every sea on the globe, Captain Nemo will\\nbid the three of us a fond farewell.”\\n\\n“Bid us a fond farewell?” the Canadian exclaimed. “You mean beat us to\\na fare-thee-well!”\\n\\n“Let’s not exaggerate, Mr. Land,” I went on. “We have nothing to fear\\nfrom the captain, but neither do I share Conseil’s views. We’re privy\\nto the Nautilus’s secrets, and I don’t expect that its commander, just\\nto set us free, will meekly stand by while we spread those secrets all\\nover the world.”\\n\\n“But in that case what do you expect?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“That we’ll encounter advantageous conditions for escaping just as\\nreadily in six months as now.”\\n\\n“Great Scott!” Ned Land put in. “And where, if you please, will we be\\nin six months, Mr. Naturalist?”\\n\\n“Perhaps here, perhaps in China. You know how quickly the Nautilus\\nmoves. It crosses oceans like swallows cross the air or express trains\\ncontinents. It doesn’t fear heavily traveled seas. Who can say it\\nwon’t hug the coasts of France, England, or America, where an escape\\nattempt could be carried out just as effectively as here.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” the Canadian replied, “your arguments are rotten\\nto the core. You talk way off in the future: ‘We’ll be here, we’ll be\\nthere!’ Me, I’m talking about right now: we are here, and we must take\\nadvantage of it!”\\n\\nI was hard pressed by Ned Land’s common sense, and I felt myself\\nlosing ground. I no longer knew what arguments to put forward on my\\nbehalf.\\n\\n“Sir,” Ned went on, “let’s suppose that by some impossibility, Captain\\nNemo offered your freedom to you this very day. Would you accept?”\\n\\n“I don’t know,” I replied.\\n\\n“And suppose he adds that this offer he’s making you today won’t ever\\nbe repeated, then would you accept?”\\n\\nI did not reply.\\n\\n“And what thinks our friend Conseil?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“Your friend Conseil,” the fine lad replied serenely, “has nothing to\\nsay for himself. He’s a completely disinterested party on this\\nquestion. Like his master, like his comrade Ned, he’s a\\nbachelor. Neither wife, parents, nor children are waiting for him back\\nhome. He’s in master’s employ, he thinks like master, he speaks like\\nmaster, and much to his regret, he can’t be counted on to form a\\nmajority. Only two persons face each other here: master on one side,\\nNed Land on the other. That said, your friend Conseil is listening,\\nand he’s ready to keep score.”\\n\\nI couldn’t help smiling as Conseil wiped himself out of\\nexistence. Deep down, the Canadian must have been overjoyed at not\\nhaving to contend with him.\\n\\n“Then, sir,” Ned Land said, “since Conseil is no more, we’ll have this\\ndiscussion between just the two of us. I’ve talked, you’ve\\nlistened. What’s your reply?”\\n\\nIt was obvious that the matter had to be settled, and evasions were\\ndistasteful to me.\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I said, “here’s my reply. You have right on your side\\nand my arguments can’t stand up to yours. It will never do to count on\\nCaptain Nemo’s benevolence. The most ordinary good sense would forbid\\nhim to set us free. On the other hand, good sense decrees that we take\\nadvantage of our first opportunity to leave the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“Fine, Professor Aronnax, that’s wisely said.”\\n\\n“But one proviso,” I said, “just one. The opportunity must be the real\\nthing. Our first attempt to escape must succeed, because if it\\nmisfires, we won’t get a second chance, and Captain Nemo will never\\nforgive us.”\\n\\n“That’s also well put,” the Canadian replied. “But your proviso\\napplies to any escape attempt, whether it happens in two years or two\\ndays. So this is still the question: if a promising opportunity comes\\nup, we have to grab it.”\\n\\n“Agreed. And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a promising\\nopportunity?”\\n\\n“One that leads the Nautilus on a cloudy night within a short distance\\nof some European coast.”\\n\\n“And you’ll try to get away by swimming?”\\n\\n“Yes, if we’re close enough to shore and the ship’s afloat on the\\nsurface. No, if we’re well out and the ship’s navigating under the\\nwaters.”\\n\\n“And in that event?”\\n\\n“In that event I’ll try to get hold of the skiff. I know how to handle\\nit. We’ll stick ourselves inside, undo the bolts, and rise to the\\nsurface, without the helmsman in the bow seeing a thing.”\\n\\n“Fine, Ned. Stay on the lookout for such an opportunity, but don’t\\nforget, one slipup will finish us.”\\n\\n“I won’t forget, sir.”\\n\\n“And now, Ned, would you like to know my overall thinking on your\\nplan?”\\n\\n“Gladly, Professor Aronnax.”\\n\\n“Well then, I think—and I don’t mean ‘I hope’—that your promising\\nopportunity won’t ever arise.”\\n\\n“Why not?”\\n\\n“Because Captain Nemo recognizes that we haven’t given up all hope of\\nrecovering our freedom, and he’ll keep on his guard, above all in seas\\nwithin sight of the coasts of Europe.”\\n\\n“I’m of master’s opinion,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“We’ll soon see,” Ned Land replied, shaking his head with a determined\\nexpression.\\n\\n“And now, Ned Land,” I added, “let’s leave it at that. Not another\\nword on any of this. The day you’re ready, alert us and we’re with\\nyou. I turn it all over to you.”\\n\\nThat’s how we ended this conversation, which later was to have such\\nserious consequences. At first, I must say, events seemed to confirm\\nmy forecasts, much to the Canadian’s despair. Did Captain Nemo view us\\nwith distrust in these heavily traveled seas, or did he simply want to\\nhide from the sight of those ships of every nation that plowed the\\nMediterranean? I have no idea, but usually he stayed in midwater and\\nwell out from any coast. Either the Nautilus surfaced only enough to\\nlet its pilothouse emerge, or it slipped away to the lower depths,\\nalthough, between the Greek Islands and Asia Minor, we didn’t find\\nbottom even at 2,000 meters down.\\n\\nAccordingly, I became aware of the isle of Karpathos, one of the\\nSporades Islands, only when Captain Nemo placed his finger over a spot\\non the world map and quoted me this verse from Virgil:\\n\\nEst in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates\\n\\nCaeruleus Proteus . . .*\\n\\n*Latin: “There in King Neptune’s domain by Karpathos, his spokesman /\\n is azure-hued Proteus . . . ” Ed.\\n\\nIt was indeed that bygone abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of King\\nNeptune’s flocks: an island located between Rhodes and Crete, which\\nGreeks now call Karpathos, Italians Scarpanto. Through the lounge\\nwindow I could see only its granite bedrock.\\n\\nThe next day, February 14, I decided to spend a few hours studying the\\nfish of this island group; but for whatever reason, the panels\\nremained hermetically sealed. After determining the Nautilus’s\\nheading, I noted that it was proceeding toward the ancient island of\\nCrete, also called Candia. At the time I had shipped aboard the\\nAbraham Lincoln, this whole island was in rebellion against its\\ntyrannical rulers, the Ottoman Empire of Turkey. But since then I had\\nabsolutely no idea what happened to this revolution, and Captain Nemo,\\ndeprived of all contact with the shore, was hardly the man to keep me\\ninformed.\\n\\nSo I didn’t allude to this event when, that evening, I chanced to be\\nalone with the captain in the lounge. Besides, he seemed silent and\\npreoccupied. Then, contrary to custom, he ordered that both panels in\\nthe lounge be opened, and going from the one to the other, he\\ncarefully observed the watery mass. For what purpose? I hadn’t a\\nguess, and for my part, I spent my time studying the fish that passed\\nbefore my eyes.\\n\\nAmong others I noted that sand goby mentioned by Aristotle and\\ncommonly known by the name sea loach, which is encountered exclusively\\nin the salty waters next to the Nile Delta. Near them some\\nsemiphosphorescent red porgy rolled by, a variety of gilthead that the\\nEgyptians ranked among their sacred animals, lauding them in religious\\nceremonies when their arrival in the river’s waters announced the\\nfertile flood season. I also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro,\\nthree decimeters long, bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish\\ngray color is mixed with red spots; they’re enthusiastic eaters of\\nmarine vegetables, which gives them an exquisite flavor; hence these\\ntapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient Rome, and their\\nentrails were dressed with brains of peacock, tongue of flamingo, and\\ntestes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the\\nRoman emperor Vitellius.\\n\\nAnother resident of these seas caught my attention and revived all my\\nmemories of antiquity. This was the remora, which travels attached to\\nthe bellies of sharks; as the ancients tell it, when these little fish\\ncling to the undersides of a ship, they can bring it to a halt, and by\\nso impeding\\n\\nMark Antony’s vessel during the Battle of Actium, one of them\\nfacilitated the victory of Augustus Caesar. From such slender threads\\nhang the destinies of nations! I also observed some wonderful snappers\\nbelonging to the order Lutianida, sacred fish for the Greeks, who\\nclaimed they could drive off sea monsters from the waters they\\nfrequent; their Greek name anthias means “flower,” and they live up to\\nit in the play of their colors and in those fleeting reflections that\\nturn their dorsal fins into watered silk; their hues are confined to a\\ngamut of reds, from the pallor of pink to the glow of ruby. I couldn’t\\ntake my eyes off these marine wonders, when I was suddenly jolted by\\nan unexpected apparition.\\n\\nIn the midst of the waters, a man appeared, a diver carrying a little\\nleather bag at his belt. It was no corpse lost in the waves. It was a\\nliving man, swimming vigorously, sometimes disappearing to breathe at\\nthe surface, then instantly diving again.\\n\\nI turned to Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice:\\n\\n“A man! A castaway!” I exclaimed. “We must rescue him at all cost!”\\n\\nThe captain didn’t reply but went to lean against the window.\\n\\nThe man drew near, and gluing his face to the panel, he stared at us.\\n\\nTo my deep astonishment, Captain Nemo gave him a signal. The diver\\nanswered with his hand, immediately swam up to the surface of the sea,\\nand didn’t reappear.\\n\\n“Don’t be alarmed,” the captain told me. “That’s Nicolas from Cape\\nMatapan, nicknamed ‘Il Pesce.’* He’s well known throughout the\\nCyclades Islands. A bold diver! Water is his true element, and he\\nlives in the sea more than on shore, going constantly from one island\\nto another, even to Crete.”\\n\\n*Italian: “The Fish.” Ed.\\n\\n“You know him, captain?”\\n\\n“Why not, Professor Aronnax?”\\n\\nThis said, Captain Nemo went to a cabinet standing near the lounge’s\\nleft panel. Next to this cabinet I saw a chest bound with hoops of\\niron, its lid bearing a copper plaque that displayed the Nautilus’s\\nmonogram with its motto Mobilis in Mobili.\\n\\nJust then, ignoring my presence, the captain opened this cabinet, a\\nsort of safe that contained a large number of ingots.\\n\\nThey were gold ingots. And they represented an enormous sum of\\nmoney. Where had this precious metal come from? How had the captain\\namassed this gold, and what was he about to do with it?\\n\\nI didn’t pronounce a word. I gaped. Captain Nemo took out the ingots\\none by one and arranged them methodically inside the chest, filling it\\nto the top. At which point I estimate that it held more than 1,000\\nkilograms of gold, in other words, close to 5,000,000 francs.\\n\\nAfter securely fastening the chest, Captain Nemo wrote an address on\\nits lid in characters that must have been modern Greek.\\n\\nThis done, the captain pressed a button whose wiring was in\\ncommunication with the crew’s quarters. Four men appeared and, not\\nwithout difficulty, pushed the chest out of the lounge. Then I heard\\nthem hoist it up the iron companionway by means of pulleys.\\n\\nJust then Captain Nemo turned to me:\\n\\n“You were saying, professor?” he asked me.\\n\\n“I wasn’t saying a thing, captain.”\\n\\n“Then, sir, with your permission, I’ll bid you good evening.”\\n\\nAnd with that, Captain Nemo left the lounge.\\n\\nI reentered my stateroom, very puzzled, as you can imagine. I tried in\\nvain to fall asleep. I kept searching for a relationship between the\\nappearance of the diver and that chest filled with gold. Soon, from\\ncertain rolling and pitching movements, I sensed that the Nautilus had\\nleft the lower strata and was back on the surface of the water.\\n\\nThen I heard the sound of footsteps on the platform. I realized that\\nthe skiff was being detached and launched to sea. For an instant it\\nbumped the Nautilus’s side, then all sounds ceased.\\n\\nTwo hours later, the same noises, the same comings and goings, were\\nrepeated. Hoisted on board, the longboat was readjusted into its\\nsocket, and the Nautilus plunged back beneath the waves.\\n\\nSo those millions had been delivered to their address. At what spot on\\nthe continent? Who was the recipient of Captain Nemo’s gold?\\n\\nThe next day I related the night’s events to Conseil and the Canadian,\\nevents that had aroused my curiosity to a fever pitch. My companions\\nwere as startled as I was.\\n\\n“But where does he get those millions?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\nTo this no reply was possible. After breakfast I made my way to the\\nlounge and went about my work. I wrote up my notes until five o’clock\\nin the afternoon. Just then—was it due to some personal\\nindisposition?—I felt extremely hot and had to take off my jacket made\\nof fan mussel fabric. A perplexing circumstance because we weren’t in\\nthe low latitudes, and besides, once the Nautilus was submerged, it\\nshouldn’t be subject to any rise in temperature. I looked at the\\npressure gauge. It marked a depth of sixty feet, a depth beyond the\\nreach of atmospheric heat.\\n\\nI kept on working, but the temperature rose to the point of becoming\\nunbearable.\\n\\n“Could there be a fire on board?” I wondered.\\n\\nI was about to leave the lounge when Captain Nemo entered. He\\napproached the thermometer, consulted it, and turned to me:\\n\\n“42 degrees centigrade,” he said.\\n\\n“I’ve detected as much, captain,” I replied, “and if it gets even\\nslightly hotter, we won’t be able to stand it.”\\n\\n“Oh, professor, it won’t get any hotter unless we want it to!”\\n\\n“You mean you can control this heat?”\\n\\n“No, but I can back away from the fireplace producing it.”\\n\\n“So it’s outside?”\\n\\n“Surely. We’re cruising in a current of boiling water.”\\n\\n“It can’t be!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Look.”\\n\\nThe panels had opened, and I could see a completely white sea around\\nthe Nautilus. Steaming sulfurous fumes uncoiled in the midst of waves\\nbubbling like water in a boiler. I leaned my hand against one of the\\nwindows, but the heat was so great, I had to snatch it back.\\n\\n“Where are we?” I asked.\\n\\n“Near the island of Santorini, professor,” the captain answered me,\\n“and right in the channel that separates the volcanic islets of Nea\\nKameni and Palea Kameni. I wanted to offer you the unusual sight of an\\nunderwater eruption.”\\n\\n“I thought,” I said, “that the formation of such new islands had come\\nto an end.”\\n\\n“Nothing ever comes to an end in these volcanic waterways,” Captain\\nNemo replied, “and thanks to its underground fires, our globe is\\ncontinuously under construction in these regions. According to the\\nLatin historians Cassiodorus and Pliny, by the year 19 of the\\nChristian era, a new island, the divine Thera, had already appeared in\\nthe very place these islets have more recently formed. Then Thera sank\\nunder the waves, only to rise and sink once more in the year 69\\nA.D. From that day to this, such plutonic construction work has been\\nin abeyance. But on February 3, 1866, a new islet named George Island\\nemerged in the midst of sulfurous steam near Nea Kameni and was fused\\nto it on the 6th of the same month. Seven days later, on February 13,\\nthe islet of Aphroessa appeared, leaving a ten-meter channel between\\nitself and Nea Kameni. I was in these seas when that phenomenon\\noccurred and I was able to observe its every phase. The islet of\\nAphroessa was circular in shape, measuring 300 feet in diameter and\\nthirty feet in height. It was made of black, glassy lava mixed with\\nbits of feldspar. Finally, on March 10, a smaller islet called Reka\\nappeared next to Nea Kameni, and since then, these three islets have\\nfused to form one single, selfsame island.”\\n\\n“What about this channel we’re in right now?” I asked.\\n\\n“Here it is,” Captain Nemo replied, showing me a chart of the Greek\\nIslands. “You observe that I’ve entered the new islets in their\\nplace.”\\n\\n“But will this channel fill up one day?”\\n\\n“Very likely, Professor Aronnax, because since 1866 eight little lava\\nislets have surged up in front of the port of St. Nicolas on Palea\\nKameni. So it’s obvious that Nea and Palea will join in days to\\ncome. In the middle of the Pacific, tiny infusoria build continents,\\nbut here they’re built by volcanic phenomena. Look, sir! Look at the\\nconstruction work going on under these waves.”\\n\\nI returned to the window. The Nautilus was no longer moving. The heat\\nhad become unbearable. From the white it had recently been, the sea\\nwas turning red, a coloration caused by the presence of iron\\nsalts. Although the lounge was hermetically sealed, it was filling\\nwith an intolerable stink of sulfur, and I could see scarlet flames of\\nsuch brightness, they overpowered our electric light.\\n\\nI was swimming in perspiration, I was stifling, I was about to be\\ncooked. Yes, I felt myself cooking in actual fact!\\n\\n“We can’t stay any longer in this boiling water,” I told the captain.\\n\\n“No, it wouldn’t be advisable,” replied Nemo the Emotionless.\\n\\nHe gave an order. The Nautilus tacked about and retreated from this\\nfurnace it couldn’t brave with impunity. A quarter of an hour later,\\nwe were breathing fresh air on the surface of the waves.\\n\\nIt then occurred to me that if Ned had chosen these waterways for our\\nescape attempt, we wouldn’t have come out alive from this sea of fire.\\n\\nThe next day, February 16, we left this basin, which tallies depths of\\n3,000 meters between Rhodes and Alexandria, and passing well out from\\nCerigo Island after doubling Cape Matapan, the Nautilus left the Greek\\nIslands behind.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nThe Mediterranean in Forty-Eight Hours\\n\\n\\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN, your ideal blue sea: to Greeks simply “the sea,” to\\nHebrews “the great sea,” to Romans mare nostrum.* Bordered by orange\\ntrees, aloes, cactus, and maritime pine trees, perfumed with the scent\\nof myrtle, framed by rugged mountains, saturated with clean,\\ntransparent air but continuously under construction by fires in the\\nearth, this sea is a genuine battlefield where Neptune and Pluto still\\nstruggle for world domination. Here on these beaches and waters, says\\nthe French historian Michelet, a man is revived by one of the most\\ninvigorating climates in the world.\\n\\n*Latin: “our sea.” Ed.\\n\\nBut as beautiful as it was, I could get only a quick look at this\\nbasin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers. Even\\nCaptain Nemo’s personal insights were denied me, because that\\nmystifying individual didn’t appear one single time during our\\nhigh-speed crossing. I estimate that the Nautilus covered a track of\\nsome 600 leagues under the waves of this sea, and this voyage was\\naccomplished in just twenty-four hours times two. Departing from the\\nwaterways of Greece on the morning of February 16, we cleared the\\nStrait of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.\\n\\nIt was obvious to me that this Mediterranean, pinned in the middle of\\nthose shores he wanted to avoid, gave Captain Nemo no pleasure. Its\\nwaves and breezes brought back too many memories, if not too many\\nregrets. Here he no longer had the ease of movement and freedom of\\nmaneuver that the oceans allowed him, and his Nautilus felt cramped so\\nclose to the coasts of both Africa and Europe.\\n\\nAccordingly, our speed was twenty-five miles (that is, twelve\\nfour-kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to\\ngive up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the\\nrate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use\\nof the skiff. Leaving the Nautilus under these conditions would have\\nbeen like jumping off a train racing at this speed, a rash move if\\nthere ever was one. Moreover, to renew our air supply, the submersible\\nrose to the surface of the waves only at night, and relying solely on\\ncompass and log, it steered by dead reckoning.\\n\\nInside the Mediterranean, then, I could catch no more of its\\nfast-passing scenery than a traveler might see from an express train;\\nin other words, I could view only the distant horizons because the\\nforegrounds flashed by like lightning. But Conseil and I were able to\\nobserve those Mediterranean fish whose powerful fins kept pace for a\\nwhile in the Nautilus’s waters. We stayed on watch before the lounge\\nwindows, and our notes enable me to reconstruct, in a few words, the\\nichthyology of this sea.\\n\\nAmong the various fish inhabiting it, some I viewed, others I\\nglimpsed, and the rest I missed completely because of the Nautilus’s\\nspeed. Kindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system of\\nclassification. It will at least convey the quickness of my\\nobservations.\\n\\nIn the midst of the watery mass, brightly lit by our electric beams,\\nthere snaked past those one-meter lampreys that are common to nearly\\nevery clime. A type of ray from the genus Oxyrhynchus, five feet wide,\\nhad a white belly with a spotted, ash-gray back and was carried along\\nby the currents like a huge, wide-open shawl. Other rays passed by so\\nquickly I couldn’t tell if they deserved that name “eagle ray” coined\\nby the ancient Greeks, or those designations of “rat ray,” “bat ray,”\\nand “toad ray” that modern fishermen have inflicted on them. Dogfish\\nknown as topes, twelve feet long and especially feared by divers, were\\nracing with each other. Looking like big bluish shadows, thresher\\nsharks went by, eight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute\\nsense of smell. Dorados from the genus Sparus, some measuring up to\\nthirteen decimeters, appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled\\nwith ribbons, which contrasted with the dark color of their fins; fish\\nsacred to the goddess Venus, their eyes set in brows of gold; a\\nvaluable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt, equally at\\nhome in rivers, lakes, and oceans, living in every clime, tolerating\\nany temperature, their line dating back to prehistoric times on this\\nearth yet preserving all its beauty from those far-off\\ndays. Magnificent sturgeons, nine to ten meters long and extremely\\nfast, banged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels,\\nshowing bluish backs with small brown spots; they resemble sharks,\\nwithout equaling their strength, and are encountered in every sea; in\\nthe spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers, fighting the\\ncurrents of the Volga, Danube, Po, Rhine, Loire, and Oder, while\\nfeeding on herring, mackerel, salmon, and codfish; although they\\nbelong to the class of cartilaginous fish, they rate as a delicacy;\\nthey’re eaten fresh, dried, marinated, or salt-preserved, and in olden\\ntimes they were borne in triumph to the table of the Roman epicure\\nLucullus.\\n\\nBut whenever the Nautilus drew near the surface, those denizens of the\\nMediterranean I could observe most productively belonged to the\\nsixty-third genus of bony fish. These were tuna from the genus\\nScomber, blue-black on top, silver on the belly armor, their dorsal\\nstripes giving off a golden gleam. They are said to follow ships in\\nsearch of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun, and they did\\njust that with the Nautilus, as they had once done with the vessels of\\nthe Count de La PΘrouse. For long hours they competed in speed with\\nour submersible. I couldn’t stop marveling at these animals so\\nperfectly cut out for racing, their heads small, their bodies sleek,\\nspindle-shaped, and in some cases over three meters long, their\\npectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength, their caudal fins\\nforked. Like certain flocks of birds, whose speed they equal, these\\ntuna swim in triangle formation, which prompted the ancients to say\\nthey’d boned up on geometry and military strategy. And yet they can’t\\nescape the Provenτal fishermen, who prize them as highly as did the\\nancient inhabitants of Turkey and Italy; and these valuable animals,\\nas oblivious as if they were deaf and blind, leap right into the\\nMarseilles tuna nets and perish by the thousands.\\n\\nJust for the record, I’ll mention those Mediterranean fish that\\nConseil and I barely glimpsed. There were whitish eels of the species\\nGymnotus fasciatus that passed like elusive wisps of steam, conger\\neels three to four meters long that were tricked out in green, blue,\\nand yellow, three-foot hake with a liver that makes a dainty morsel,\\nwormfish drifting like thin seaweed, sea robins that poets call\\nlyrefish and seamen pipers and whose snouts have two jagged triangular\\nplates shaped like old Homer’s lyre, swallowfish swimming as fast as\\nthe bird they’re named after, redheaded groupers whose dorsal fins are\\ntrimmed with filaments, some shad (spotted with black, gray, brown,\\nblue, yellow, and green) that actually respond to tinkling handbells,\\nsplendid diamond-shaped turbot that were like aquatic pheasants with\\nyellowish fins stippled in brown and the left topside mostly marbled\\nin brown and yellow, finally schools of wonderful red mullet, real\\noceanic birds of paradise that ancient Romans bought for as much as\\n10,000 sesterces apiece, and which they killed at the table, so they\\ncould heartlessly watch it change color from cinnabar red when alive\\nto pallid white when dead.\\n\\nAnd as for other fish common to the Atlantic and Mediterranean, I was\\nunable to observe miralets, triggerfish, puffers, seahorses,\\njewelfish, trumpetfish, blennies, gray mullet, wrasse, smelt, flying\\nfish, anchovies, sea bream, porgies, garfish, or any of the chief\\nrepresentatives of the order Pleuronecta, such as sole, flounder,\\nplaice, dab, and brill, simply because of the dizzying speed with\\nwhich the Nautilus hustled through these opulent waters.\\n\\nAs for marine mammals, on passing by the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, I\\nthought I recognized two or three sperm whales equipped with the\\nsingle dorsal fin denoting the genus Physeter, some pilot whales from\\nthe genus Globicephalus exclusive to the Mediterranean, the forepart\\nof the head striped with small distinct lines, and also a dozen seals\\nwith white bellies and black coats, known by the name monk seals and\\njust as solemn as if they were three-meter Dominicans.\\n\\nFor his part, Conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide and\\nadorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise. I was sorry\\nto miss this reptile, because from Conseil’s description, I believe I\\nrecognized the leatherback turtle, a pretty rare species. For my part,\\nI noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces.\\n\\nAs for zoophytes, for a few moments I was able to marvel at a\\nwonderful, orange-hued hydra from the genus Galeolaria that clung to\\nthe glass of our port panel; it consisted of a long, lean filament\\nthat spread out into countless branches and ended in the most delicate\\nlace ever spun by the followers of Arachne. Unfortunately I couldn’t\\nfish up this wonderful specimen, and surely no other Mediterranean\\nzoophytes would have been offered to my gaze, if, on the evening of\\nthe 16th, the Nautilus hadn’t slowed down in an odd fashion. This was\\nthe situation.\\n\\nBy then we were passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunisia. In\\nthe cramped space between Cape Bon and the Strait of Messina, the sea\\nbottom rises almost all at once. It forms an actual ridge with only\\nseventeen meters of water remaining above it, while the depth on\\neither side is 170 meters. Consequently, the Nautilus had to maneuver\\nwith caution so as not to bump into this underwater barrier.\\n\\nI showed Conseil the position of this long reef on our chart of the\\nMediterranean.\\n\\n“But with all due respect to master,” Conseil ventured to observe,\\n“it’s like an actual isthmus connecting Europe to Africa.”\\n\\n“Yes, my boy,” I replied, “it cuts across the whole Strait of Sicily,\\nand Smith’s soundings prove that in the past, these two continents\\nwere genuinely connected between Cape Boeo and Cape Farina.”\\n\\n“I can easily believe it,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“I might add,” I went on, “that there’s a similar barrier between\\nGibraltar and Ceuta, and in prehistoric times it closed off the\\nMediterranean completely.”\\n\\n“Gracious!” Conseil put in. “Suppose one day some volcanic upheaval\\nraises these two barriers back above the waves!”\\n\\n“That’s most unlikely, Conseil.”\\n\\n“If master will allow me to finish, I mean that if this phenomenon\\noccurs, it might prove distressing to Mr. de Lesseps, who has gone to\\nsuch pains to cut through his isthmus!”\\n\\n“Agreed, but I repeat, Conseil: such a phenomenon won’t occur. The\\nintensity of these underground forces continues to diminish. Volcanoes\\nwere quite numerous in the world’s early days, but they’re going\\nextinct one by one; the heat inside the earth is growing weaker, the\\ntemperature in the globe’s lower strata is cooling appreciably every\\ncentury, and to our globe’s detriment, because its heat is its life.”\\n\\n“But the sun—”\\n\\n“The sun isn’t enough, Conseil. Can it restore heat to a corpse?”\\n\\n“Not that I’ve heard.”\\n\\n“Well, my friend, someday the earth will be just such a cold\\ncorpse. Like the moon, which long ago lost its vital heat, our globe\\nwill become lifeless and unlivable.”\\n\\n“In how many centuries?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“In hundreds of thousands of years, my boy.”\\n\\n“Then we have ample time to finish our voyage,” Conseil replied, “if\\nNed Land doesn’t mess things up!”\\n\\nThus reassured, Conseil went back to studying the shallows that the\\nNautilus was skimming at moderate speed.\\n\\nOn the rocky, volcanic seafloor, there bloomed quite a collection of\\nmoving flora: sponges, sea cucumbers, jellyfish called sea\\ngooseberries that were adorned with reddish tendrils and gave off a\\nsubtle phosphorescence, members of the genus Beroe that are commonly\\nknown by the name melon jellyfish and are bathed in the shimmer of the\\nwhole solar spectrum, free-swimming crinoids one meter wide that\\nreddened the waters with their crimson hue, treelike basket stars of\\nthe greatest beauty, sea fans from the genus Pavonacea with long\\nstems, numerous edible sea urchins of various species, plus green sea\\nanemones with a grayish trunk and a brown disk lost beneath the\\nolive-colored tresses of their tentacles.\\n\\nConseil kept especially busy observing mollusks and articulates, and\\nalthough his catalog is a little dry, I wouldn’t want to wrong the\\ngallant lad by leaving out his personal observations.\\n\\nFrom the branch Mollusca, he mentions numerous comb-shaped scallops,\\nhooflike spiny oysters piled on top of each other, triangular coquina,\\nthree-pronged glass snails with yellow fins and transparent shells,\\norange snails from the genus Pleurobranchus that looked like eggs\\nspotted or speckled with greenish dots, members of the genus Aplysia\\nalso known by the name sea hares, other sea hares from the genus\\nDolabella, plump paper-bubble shells, umbrella shells exclusive to the\\nMediterranean, abalone whose shell produces a mother-of-pearl much in\\ndemand, pilgrim scallops, saddle shells that diners in the French\\nprovince of Languedoc are said to like better than oysters, some of\\nthose cockleshells so dear to the citizens of Marseilles, fat white\\nvenus shells that are among the clams so abundant off the coasts of\\nNorth America and eaten in such quantities by New Yorkers, variously\\ncolored comb shells with gill covers, burrowing date mussels with a\\npeppery flavor I relish, furrowed heart cockles whose shells have\\nriblike ridges on their arching summits, triton shells pocked with\\nscarlet bumps, carniaira snails with backward-curving tips that make\\nthem resemble flimsy gondolas, crowned ferola snails, atlanta snails\\nwith spiral shells, gray nudibranchs from the genus Tethys that were\\nspotted with white and covered by fringed mantles, nudibranchs from\\nthe suborder Eolidea that looked like small slugs, sea butterflies\\ncrawling on their backs, seashells from the genus Auricula including\\nthe oval-shaped Auricula myosotis, tan wentletrap snails, common\\nperiwinkles, violet snails, cineraira snails, rock borers, ear shells,\\ncabochon snails, pandora shells, etc.\\n\\nAs for the articulates, in his notes Conseil has very appropriately\\ndivided them into six classes, three of which belong to the marine\\nworld. These classes are the Crustacea, Cirripedia, and Annelida.\\n\\nCrustaceans are subdivided into nine orders, and the first of these\\nconsists of the decapods, in other words, animals whose head and\\nthorax are usually fused, whose cheek-and-mouth mechanism is made up\\nof several pairs of appendages, and whose thorax has four, five, or\\nsix pairs of walking legs. Conseil used the methods of our mentor\\nProfessor Milne-Edwards, who puts the decapods in three divisions:\\nBrachyura, Macrura, and Anomura. These names may look a tad fierce,\\nbut they’re accurate and appropriate. Among the Brachyura, Conseil\\nmentions some amanthia crabs whose fronts were armed with two big\\ndiverging tips, those inachus scorpions that—lord knows why—symbolized\\nwisdom to the ancient Greeks, spider crabs of the massena and\\nspinimane varieties that had probably gone astray in these shallows\\nbecause they usually live in the lower depths, xanthid crabs, pilumna\\ncrabs, rhomboid crabs, granular box crabs (easy on the digestion, as\\nConseil ventured to observe), toothless masked crabs, ebalia crabs,\\ncymopolia crabs, woolly-handed crabs, etc. Among the Macrura (which\\nare subdivided into five families: hardshells, burrowers, crayfish,\\nprawns, and ghost crabs) Conseil mentions some common spiny lobsters\\nwhose females supply a meat highly prized, slipper lobsters or common\\nshrimp, waterside gebia shrimp, and all sorts of edible species, but\\nhe says nothing of the crayfish subdivision that includes the true\\nlobster, because spiny lobsters are the only type in the\\nMediterranean. Finally, among the Anomura, he saw common drocina crabs\\ndwelling inside whatever abandoned seashells they could take over,\\nhomola crabs with spiny fronts, hermit crabs, hairy porcelain crabs,\\netc.\\n\\nThere Conseil’s work came to a halt. He didn’t have time to finish off\\nthe class Crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods,\\namphipods, homopods, isopods, trilobites, branchiopods, ostracods, and\\nentomostraceans. And in order to complete his study of marine\\narticulates, he needed to mention the class Cirripedia, which contains\\nwater fleas and carp lice, plus the class Annelida, which he would\\nhave divided without fail into tubifex worms and dorsibranchian\\nworms. But having gone past the shallows of the Strait of Sicily, the\\nNautilus resumed its usual deep-water speed. From then on, no more\\nmollusks, no more zoophytes, no more articulates. Just a few large\\nfish sweeping by like shadows.\\n\\nDuring the night of February 16-17, we entered the second\\nMediterranean basin, whose maximum depth we found at 3,000 meters. The\\nNautilus, driven downward by its propeller and slanting fins,\\ndescended to the lowest strata of this sea.\\n\\nThere, in place of natural wonders, the watery mass offered some\\nthrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes. In essence, we were then\\ncrossing that part of the whole Mediterranean so fertile in\\ncasualties. From the coast of Algiers to the beaches of Provence, how\\nmany ships have wrecked, how many vessels have vanished! Compared to\\nthe vast liquid plains of the Pacific, the Mediterranean is a mere\\nlake, but it’s an unpredictable lake with fickle waves, today kindly\\nand affectionate to those frail single-masters drifting between a\\ndouble ultramarine of sky and water, tomorrow bad-tempered and\\nturbulent, agitated by the winds, demolishing the strongest ships\\nbeneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop.\\n\\nSo, in our swift cruise through these deep strata, how many vessels I\\nsaw lying on the seafloor, some already caked with coral, others clad\\nonly in a layer of rust, plus anchors, cannons, shells, iron fittings,\\npropeller blades, parts of engines, cracked cylinders, staved-in\\nboilers, then hulls floating in midwater, here upright, there\\noverturned.\\n\\nSome of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions, others from\\nhitting granite reefs. I saw a few that had sunk straight down, their\\nmasting still upright, their rigging stiffened by the water. They\\nlooked like they were at anchor by some immense, open, offshore\\nmooring where they were waiting for their departure time. When the\\nNautilus passed between them, covering them with sheets of\\nelectricity, they seemed ready to salute us with their colors and send\\nus their serial numbers! But no, nothing but silence and death filled\\nthis field of catastrophes!\\n\\nI observed that these Mediterranean depths became more and more\\ncluttered with such gruesome wreckage as the Nautilus drew nearer to\\nthe Strait of Gibraltar. By then the shores of Africa and Europe were\\nconverging, and in this narrow space collisions were\\ncommonplace. There I saw numerous iron undersides, the phantasmagoric\\nruins of steamers, some lying down, others rearing up like fearsome\\nanimals. One of these boats made a dreadful first impression: sides\\ntorn open, funnel bent, paddle wheels stripped to the mountings,\\nrudder separated from the sternpost and still hanging from an iron\\nchain, the board on its stern eaten away by marine salts! How many\\nlives were dashed in this shipwreck! How many victims were swept under\\nthe waves! Had some sailor on board lived to tell the story of this\\ndreadful disaster, or do the waves still keep this casualty a secret?\\nIt occurred to me, lord knows why, that this boat buried under the sea\\nmight have been the Atlas, lost with all hands some twenty years ago\\nand never heard from again! Oh, what a gruesome tale these\\nMediterranean depths could tell, this huge boneyard where so much\\nwealth has been lost, where so many victims have met their deaths!\\n\\nMeanwhile, briskly unconcerned, the Nautilus ran at full propeller\\nthrough the midst of these ruins. On February 18, near three o’clock\\nin the morning, it hove before the entrance to the Strait of\\nGibraltar.\\n\\nThere are two currents here: an upper current, long known to exist,\\nthat carries the ocean’s waters into the Mediterranean basin; then a\\nlower countercurrent, the only present-day proof of its existence\\nbeing logic. In essence, the Mediterranean receives a continual influx\\nof water not only from the Atlantic but from rivers emptying into it;\\nsince local evaporation isn’t enough to restore the balance, the total\\namount of added water should make this sea’s level higher every\\nyear. Yet this isn’t the case, and we’re naturally forced to believe\\nin the existence of some lower current that carries the\\nMediterranean’s surplus through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the\\nAtlantic basin.\\n\\nAnd so it turned out. The Nautilus took full advantage of this\\ncountercurrent. It advanced swiftly through this narrow\\npassageway. For an instant I could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the\\nTemple of Hercules, buried undersea, as Pliny and Avianus have\\nmentioned, together with the flat island they stand on; and a few\\nminutes later, we were floating on the waves of the Atlantic.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\nThe Bay of Vigo\\n\\n\\nTHE ATLANTIC! A vast expanse of water whose surface area is 25,000,000\\nsquare miles, with a length of 9,000 miles and an average width of\\n2,700. A major sea nearly unknown to the ancients, except perhaps the\\nCarthaginians, those Dutchmen of antiquity who went along the west\\ncoasts of Europe and Africa on their commercial junkets! An ocean\\nwhose parallel winding shores form an immense perimeter fed by the\\nworld’s greatest rivers: the St. Lawrence, Mississippi, Amazon, Plata,\\nOrinoco, Niger, Senegal, Elbe, Loire, and Rhine, which bring it waters\\nfrom the most civilized countries as well as the most undeveloped\\nareas! A magnificent plain of waves plowed continuously by ships of\\nevery nation, shaded by every flag in the world, and ending in those\\ntwo dreadful headlands so feared by navigators, Cape Horn and the Cape\\nof Tempests!\\n\\nThe Nautilus broke these waters with the edge of its spur after doing\\nnearly 10,000 leagues in three and a half months, a track longer than\\na great circle of the earth. Where were we heading now, and what did\\nthe future have in store for us?\\n\\nEmerging from the Strait of Gibraltar, the Nautilus took to the high\\nseas. It returned to the surface of the waves, so our daily strolls on\\nthe platform were restored to us.\\n\\nI climbed onto it instantly, Ned Land and Conseil along with\\nme. Twelve miles away, Cape St. Vincent was hazily visible, the\\nsouthwestern tip of the Hispanic peninsula. The wind was blowing a\\npretty strong gust from the south. The sea was swelling and\\nsurging. Its waves made the Nautilus roll and jerk violently. It was\\nnearly impossible to stand up on the platform, which was continuously\\nbuffeted by this enormously heavy sea. After inhaling a few breaths of\\nair, we went below once more.\\n\\nI repaired to my stateroom. Conseil returned to his cabin; but the\\nCanadian, looking rather worried, followed me. Our quick trip through\\nthe Mediterranean hadn’t allowed him to put his plans into execution,\\nand he could barely conceal his disappointment.\\n\\nAfter the door to my stateroom was closed, he sat and stared at me\\nsilently.\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” I told him, “I know how you feel, but you mustn’t\\nblame yourself. Given the way the Nautilus was navigating, it would\\nhave been sheer insanity to think of escaping!”\\n\\nNed Land didn’t reply. His pursed lips and frowning brow indicated\\nthat he was in the grip of his monomania.\\n\\n“Look here,” I went on, “as yet there’s no cause for despair. We’re\\ngoing up the coast of Portugal. France and England aren’t far off, and\\nthere we’ll easily find refuge. Oh, I grant you, if the Nautilus had\\nemerged from the Strait of Gibraltar and made for that cape in the\\nsouth, if it were taking us toward those regions that have no\\ncontinents, then I’d share your alarm. But we now know that Captain\\nNemo doesn’t avoid the seas of civilization, and in a few days I think\\nwe can safely take action.”\\n\\nNed Land stared at me still more intently and finally unpursed his\\nlips:\\n\\n“We’ll do it this evening,” he said.\\n\\nI straightened suddenly. I admit that I was less than ready for this\\nannouncement. I wanted to reply to the Canadian, but words failed me.\\n\\n“We agreed to wait for the right circumstances,” Ned Land went\\non. “Now we’ve got those circumstances. This evening we’ll be just a\\nfew miles off the coast of Spain. It’ll be cloudy tonight. The wind’s\\nblowing toward shore. You gave me your promise, Professor Aronnax, and\\nI’m counting on you.”\\n\\nSince I didn’t say anything, the Canadian stood up and approached me:\\n\\n“We’ll do it this evening at nine o’clock,” he said. “I’ve alerted\\nConseil. By that time Captain Nemo will be locked in his room and\\nprobably in bed. Neither the mechanics or the crewmen will be able to\\nsee us. Conseil and I will go to the central companionway. As for you,\\nProfessor Aronnax, you’ll stay in the library two steps away and wait\\nfor my signal. The oars, mast, and sail are in the skiff. I’ve even\\nmanaged to stow some provisions inside. I’ve gotten hold of a monkey\\nwrench to unscrew the nuts bolting the skiff to the Nautilus’s\\nhull. So everything’s ready. I’ll see you this evening.”\\n\\n“The sea is rough,” I said.\\n\\n“Admitted,” the Canadian replied, “but we’ve got to risk it. Freedom\\nis worth paying for. Besides, the longboat’s solidly built, and a few\\nmiles with the wind behind us is no big deal. By tomorrow, who knows\\nif this ship won’t be 100 leagues out to sea? If circumstances are in\\nour favor, between ten and eleven this evening we’ll be landing on\\nsome piece of solid ground, or we’ll be dead. So we’re in God’s hands,\\nand I’ll see you this evening!”\\n\\nThis said, the Canadian withdrew, leaving me close to dumbfounded. I\\nhad imagined that if it came to this, I would have time to think about\\nit, to talk it over. My stubborn companion hadn’t granted me this\\ncourtesy. But after all, what would I have said to him? Ned Land was\\nright a hundred times over. These were near-ideal circumstances, and\\nhe was taking full advantage of them. In my selfish personal\\ninterests, could I go back on my word and be responsible for ruining\\nthe future lives of my companions? Tomorrow, might not Captain Nemo\\ntake us far away from any shore?\\n\\nJust then a fairly loud hissing told me that the ballast tanks were\\nfilling, and the Nautilus sank beneath the waves of the Atlantic.\\n\\nI stayed in my stateroom. I wanted to avoid the captain, to hide from\\nhis eyes the agitation overwhelming me. What an agonizing day I spent,\\ntorn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at\\nabandoning this marvelous Nautilus, leaving my underwater research\\nincomplete! How could I relinquish this ocean—“my own Atlantic,” as I\\nliked to call it—without observing its lower strata, without wresting\\nfrom it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas\\nof the East Indies and the Pacific! I was putting down my novel half\\nread, I was waking up as my dream neared its climax! How painfully the\\nhours passed, as I sometimes envisioned myself safe on shore with my\\ncompanions, or, despite my better judgment, as I sometimes wished that\\nsome unforeseen circumstances would prevent Ned Land from carrying out\\nhis plans.\\n\\nTwice I went to the lounge. I wanted to consult the compass. I wanted\\nto see if the Nautilus’s heading was actually taking us closer to the\\ncoast or spiriting us farther away. But no. The Nautilus was still in\\nPortuguese waters. Heading north, it was cruising along the ocean’s\\nbeaches.\\n\\nSo I had to resign myself to my fate and get ready to escape. My\\nbaggage wasn’t heavy. My notes, nothing more.\\n\\nAs for Captain Nemo, I wondered what he would make of our escaping,\\nwhat concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him, and what he\\nwould do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being\\nfound out! Certainly I had no complaints to register with him, on the\\ncontrary. Never was hospitality more wholehearted than his. Yet in\\nleaving him I couldn’t be accused of ingratitude. No solemn promises\\nbound us to him. In order to keep us captive, he had counted only on\\nthe force of circumstances and not on our word of honor. But his\\navowed intention to imprison us forever on his ship justified our\\nevery effort.\\n\\nI hadn’t seen the captain since our visit to the island of\\nSantorini. Would fate bring me into his presence before our departure?\\nI both desired and dreaded it. I listened for footsteps in the\\nstateroom adjoining mine. Not a sound reached my ear. His stateroom\\nhad to be deserted.\\n\\nThen I began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on\\nboard. Since that night when the skiff had left the Nautilus on some\\nmysterious mission, my ideas about him had subtly changed. In spite of\\neverything, I thought that Captain Nemo must have kept up some type of\\nrelationship with the shore. Did he himself never leave the Nautilus?\\nWhole weeks had often gone by without my encountering him. What was he\\ndoing all the while? During all those times I’d thought he was\\nconvalescing in the grip of some misanthropic fit, was he instead far\\naway from the ship, involved in some secret activity whose nature\\nstill eluded me?\\n\\nAll these ideas and a thousand others assaulted me at the same\\ntime. In these strange circumstances the scope for conjecture was\\nunlimited. I felt an unbearable queasiness. This day of waiting seemed\\nendless. The hours struck too slowly to keep up with my impatience.\\n\\nAs usual, dinner was served me in my stateroom. Full of anxiety, I ate\\nlittle. I left the table at seven o’clock. 120 minutes—I was keeping\\ntrack of them—still separated me from the moment I was to rejoin Ned\\nLand. My agitation increased. My pulse was throbbing violently. I\\ncouldn’t stand still. I walked up and down, hoping to calm my troubled\\nmind with movement. The possibility of perishing in our reckless\\nundertaking was the least of my worries; my heart was pounding at the\\nthought that our plans might be discovered before we had left the\\nNautilus, at the thought of being hauled in front of Captain Nemo and\\nfinding him angered, or worse, saddened by my deserting him.\\n\\nI wanted to see the lounge one last time. I went down the gangways and\\narrived at the museum where I had spent so many pleasant and\\nproductive hours. I stared at all its wealth, all its treasures, like\\na man on the eve of his eternal exile, a man departing to return no\\nmore. For so many days now, these natural wonders and artistic\\nmasterworks had been central to my life, and I was about to leave them\\nbehind forever. I wanted to plunge my eyes through the lounge window\\nand into these Atlantic waters; but the panels were hermetically\\nsealed, and a mantle of sheet iron separated me from this ocean with\\nwhich I was still unfamiliar.\\n\\nCrossing through the lounge, I arrived at the door, contrived in one\\nof the canted corners, that opened into the captain’s stateroom. Much\\nto my astonishment, this door was ajar. I instinctively recoiled. If\\nCaptain Nemo was in his stateroom, he might see me. But, not hearing\\nany sounds, I approached. The stateroom was deserted. I pushed the\\ndoor open. I took a few steps inside. Still the same austere, monastic\\nappearance.\\n\\nJust then my eye was caught by some etchings hanging on the wall,\\nwhich I hadn’t noticed during my first visit. They were portraits of\\ngreat men of history who had spent their lives in perpetual devotion\\nto a great human ideal: Thaddeus Kosciusko, the hero whose dying words\\nhad been Finis Poloniae;* Markos Botzaris, for modern Greece the\\nreincarnation of Sparta’s King Leonidas; Daniel O’Connell, Ireland’s\\ndefender; George Washington, founder of the American Union; Daniele\\nManin, the Italian patriot; Abraham Lincoln, dead from the bullet of a\\nbeliever in slavery; and finally, that martyr for the redemption of\\nthe black race, John Brown, hanging from his gallows as Victor Hugo’s\\npencil has so terrifyingly depicted.\\n\\n*Latin: “Save Poland’s borders.” Ed.\\n\\nWhat was the bond between these heroic souls and the soul of Captain\\nNemo? From this collection of portraits could I finally unravel the\\nmystery of his existence? Was he a fighter for oppressed peoples, a\\nliberator of enslaved races? Had he figured in the recent political or\\nsocial upheavals of this century? Was he a hero of that dreadful civil\\nwar in America, a war lamentable yet forever glorious . . . ?\\n\\nSuddenly the clock struck eight. The first stroke of its hammer on the\\nchime snapped me out of my musings. I shuddered as if some invisible\\neye had plunged into my innermost thoughts, and I rushed outside the\\nstateroom.\\n\\nThere my eyes fell on the compass. Our heading was still\\nnortherly. The log indicated a moderate speed, the pressure gauge a\\ndepth of about sixty feet. So circumstances were in favor of the\\nCanadian’s plans.\\n\\nI stayed in my stateroom. I dressed warmly: fishing boots, otter cap,\\ncoat of fan-mussel fabric lined with sealskin. I was ready. I was\\nwaiting. Only the propeller’s vibrations disturbed the deep silence\\nreigning on board. I cocked an ear and listened. Would a sudden\\noutburst of voices tell me that Ned Land’s escape plans had just been\\ndetected? A ghastly uneasiness stole through me. I tried in vain to\\nrecover my composure.\\n\\nA few minutes before nine o’clock, I glued my ear to the captain’s\\ndoor. Not a sound. I left my stateroom and returned to the lounge,\\nwhich was deserted and plunged in near darkness.\\n\\nI opened the door leading to the library. The same inadequate light,\\nthe same solitude. I went to man my post near the door opening into\\nthe well of the central companionway. I waited for Ned Land’s signal.\\n\\nAt this point the propeller’s vibrations slowed down appreciably, then\\nthey died out altogether. Why was the Nautilus stopping? Whether this\\nlayover would help or hinder Ned Land’s schemes I couldn’t have said.\\n\\nThe silence was further disturbed only by the pounding of my heart.\\n\\nSuddenly I felt a mild jolt. I realized the Nautilus had come to rest\\non the ocean floor. My alarm increased. The Canadian’s signal hadn’t\\nreached me. I longed to rejoin Ned Land and urge him to postpone his\\nattempt. I sensed that we were no longer navigating under normal\\nconditions.\\n\\nJust then the door to the main lounge opened and Captain Nemo\\nappeared. He saw me, and without further preamble:\\n\\n“Ah, professor,” he said in an affable tone, “I’ve been looking for\\nyou. Do you know your Spanish history?”\\n\\nEven if he knew it by heart, a man in my disturbed, befuddled\\ncondition couldn’t have quoted a syllable of his own country’s\\nhistory.\\n\\n“Well?” Captain Nemo went on. “Did you hear my question? Do you know\\nthe history of Spain?”\\n\\n“Very little of it,” I replied.\\n\\n“The most learned men,” the captain said, “still have much to\\nlearn. Have a seat,” he added, “and I’ll tell you about an unusual\\nepisode in this body of history.”\\n\\nThe captain stretched out on a couch, and I mechanically took a seat\\nnear him, but half in the shadows.\\n\\n“Professor,” he said, “listen carefully. This piece of history\\nconcerns you in one definite respect, because it will answer a\\nquestion you’ve no doubt been unable to resolve.”\\n\\n“I’m listening, captain,” I said, not knowing what my partner in this\\ndialogue was driving at, and wondering if this incident related to our\\nescape plans.\\n\\n“Professor,” Captain Nemo went on, “if you’re amenable, we’ll go back\\nin time to 1702. You’re aware of the fact that in those days your King\\nLouis XIV thought an imperial gesture would suffice to humble the\\nPyrenees in the dust, so he inflicted his grandson, the Duke of Anjou,\\non the Spaniards. Reigning more or less poorly under the name King\\nPhilip V, this aristocrat had to deal with mighty opponents abroad.\\n\\n“In essence, the year before, the royal houses of Holland, Austria,\\nand England had signed a treaty of alliance at The Hague, aiming to\\nwrest the Spanish crown from King Philip V and to place it on the head\\nof an archduke whom they prematurely dubbed King Charles III.\\n\\n“Spain had to withstand these allies. But the country had practically\\nno army or navy. Yet it wasn’t short of money, provided that its\\ngalleons, laden with gold and silver from America, could enter its\\nports. Now then, late in 1702 Spain was expecting a rich convoy, which\\nFrance ventured to escort with a fleet of twenty-three vessels under\\nthe command of Admiral de Chateau-Renault, because by that time the\\nallied navies were roving the Atlantic.\\n\\n“This convoy was supposed to put into Cadiz, but after learning that\\nthe English fleet lay across those waterways, the admiral decided to\\nmake for a French port.\\n\\n“The Spanish commanders in the convoy objected to this decision. They\\nwanted to be taken to a Spanish port, if not to Cadiz, then to the Bay\\nof Vigo, located on Spain’s northwest coast and not blockaded.\\n\\n“Admiral de Chateau-Renault was so indecisive as to obey this\\ndirective, and the galleons entered the Bay of Vigo.\\n\\n“Unfortunately this bay forms an open, offshore mooring that’s\\nimpossible to defend. So it was essential to hurry and empty the\\ngalleons before the allied fleets arrived, and there would have been\\nample time for this unloading, if a wretched question of trade\\nagreements hadn’t suddenly come up.\\n\\n“Are you clear on the chain of events?” Captain Nemo asked me.\\n\\n“Perfectly clear,” I said, not yet knowing why I was being given this\\nhistory lesson.\\n\\n“Then I’ll continue. Here’s what came to pass. The tradesmen of Cadiz\\nhad negotiated a charter whereby they were to receive all merchandise\\ncoming from the West Indies. Now then, unloading the ingots from those\\ngalleons at the port of Vigo would have been a violation of their\\nrights. So they lodged a complaint in Madrid, and they obtained an\\norder from the indecisive King Philip V: without unloading, the convoy\\nwould stay in custody at the offshore mooring of Vigo until the enemy\\nfleets had retreated.\\n\\n“Now then, just as this decision was being handed down, English\\nvessels arrived in the Bay of Vigo on October 22, 1702. Despite his\\ninferior forces, Admiral de Chateau-Renault fought courageously. But\\nwhen he saw that the convoy’s wealth was about to fall into enemy\\nhands, he burned and scuttled the galleons, which went to the bottom\\nwith their immense treasures.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stopped. I admit it: I still couldn’t see how this piece\\nof history concerned me.\\n\\n“Well?” I asked him.\\n\\n“Well, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo answered me, “we’re actually\\nin that Bay of Vigo, and all that’s left is for you to probe the\\nmysteries of the place.”\\n\\nThe captain stood up and invited me to follow him. I’d had time to\\ncollect myself. I did so. The lounge was dark, but the sea’s waves\\nsparkled through the transparent windows. I stared.\\n\\nAround the Nautilus for a half-mile radius, the waters seemed\\nsaturated with electric light. The sandy bottom was clear and\\nbright. Dressed in diving suits, crewmen were busy clearing away\\nhalf-rotted barrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy\\nhulks of ships. Out of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold\\nand silver, cascades of jewels, pieces of eight. The sand was heaped\\nwith them. Then, laden with these valuable spoils, the men returned to\\nthe Nautilus, dropped off their burdens inside, and went to resume\\nthis inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold.\\n\\nI understood. This was the setting of that battle on October 22,\\n1702. Here, in this very place, those galleons carrying treasure to\\nthe Spanish government had gone to the bottom. Here, whenever he\\nneeded, Captain Nemo came to withdraw these millions to ballast his\\nNautilus. It was for him, for him alone, that America had yielded up\\nits precious metals. He was the direct, sole heir to these treasures\\nwrested from the Incas and those peoples conquered by Hernando Cortez!\\n\\n“Did you know, professor,” he asked me with a smile, “that the sea\\ncontained such wealth?”\\n\\n“I know it’s estimated,” I replied, “that there are 2,000,000 metric\\ntons of silver held in suspension in seawater.”\\n\\n“Surely, but in extracting that silver, your expenses would outweigh\\nyour profits. Here, by contrast, I have only to pick up what other men\\nhave lost, and not only in this Bay of Vigo but at a thousand other\\nsites where ships have gone down, whose positions are marked on my\\nunderwater chart. Do you understand now that I’m rich to the tune of\\nbillions?”\\n\\n“I understand, captain. Nevertheless, allow me to inform you that by\\nharvesting this very Bay of Vigo, you’re simply forestalling the\\nefforts of a rival organization.”\\n\\n“What organization?”\\n\\n“A company chartered by the Spanish government to search for these\\nsunken galleons. The company’s investors were lured by the bait of\\nenormous gains, because this scuttled treasure is estimated to be\\nworth 500,000,000 francs.”\\n\\n“It was 500,000,000 francs,” Captain Nemo replied, “but no more!”\\n\\n“Right,” I said. “Hence a timely warning to those investors would be\\nan act of charity. Yet who knows if it would be well received? Usually\\nwhat gamblers regret the most isn’t the loss of their money so much as\\nthe loss of their insane hopes. But ultimately I feel less sorry for\\nthem than for the thousands of unfortunate people who would have\\nbenefited from a fair distribution of this wealth, whereas now it will\\nbe of no help to them!”\\n\\nNo sooner had I voiced this regret than I felt it must have wounded\\nCaptain Nemo.\\n\\n“No help!” he replied with growing animation. “Sir, what makes you\\nassume this wealth goes to waste when I’m the one amassing it? Do you\\nthink I toil to gather this treasure out of selfishness? Who says I\\ndon’t put it to good use? Do you think I’m unaware of the suffering\\nbeings and oppressed races living on this earth, poor people to\\ncomfort, victims to avenge? Don’t you understand . . . ?”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo stopped on these last words, perhaps sorry that he had\\nsaid too much. But I had guessed. Whatever motives had driven him to\\nseek independence under the seas, he remained a human being before all\\nelse! His heart still throbbed for suffering humanity, and his immense\\nphilanthropy went out both to downtrodden races and to individuals!\\n\\nAnd now I knew where Captain Nemo had delivered those millions, when\\nthe Nautilus navigated the waters where Crete was in rebellion against\\nthe Ottoman Empire!\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nA Lost Continent\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT MORNING, February 19, I beheld the Canadian entering my\\nstateroom. I was expecting this visit. He wore an expression of great\\ndisappointment.\\n\\n“Well, sir?” he said to me.\\n\\n“Well, Ned, the fates were against us yesterday.”\\n\\n“Yes! That damned captain had to call a halt just as we were going to\\nescape from his boat.”\\n\\n“Yes, Ned, he had business with his bankers.”\\n\\n“His bankers?”\\n\\n“Or rather his bank vaults. By which I mean this ocean, where his\\nwealth is safer than in any national treasury.”\\n\\nI then related the evening’s incidents to the Canadian, secretly\\nhoping he would come around to the idea of not deserting the captain;\\nbut my narrative had no result other than Ned’s voicing deep regret\\nthat he hadn’t strolled across the Vigo battlefield on his own behalf.\\n\\n“Anyhow,” he said, “it’s not over yet! My first harpoon missed, that’s\\nall! We’ll succeed the next time, and as soon as this evening, if need\\nbe . . .”\\n\\n“What’s the Nautilus’s heading?” I asked.\\n\\n“I’ve no idea,” Ned replied.\\n\\n“All right, at noon we’ll find out what our position is!”\\n\\nThe Canadian returned to Conseil’s side. As soon as I was dressed, I\\nwent into the lounge. The compass wasn’t encouraging. The Nautilus’s\\ncourse was south-southwest. We were turning our backs on Europe.\\n\\nI could hardly wait until our position was reported on the chart. Near\\n11:30 the ballast tanks emptied, and the submersible rose to the\\nsurface of the ocean. I leaped onto the platform. Ned Land was already\\nthere.\\n\\nNo more shore in sight. Nothing but the immenseness of the sea. A few\\nsails were on the horizon, no doubt ships going as far as Cape São\\nRoque to find favorable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The\\nsky was overcast. A squall was on the way.\\n\\nFurious, Ned tried to see through the mists on the horizon. He still\\nhoped that behind all that fog there lay those shores he longed for.\\n\\nAt noon the sun made a momentary appearance. Taking advantage of this\\nrift in the clouds, the chief officer took the orb’s altitude. Then\\nthe sea grew turbulent, we went below again, and the hatch closed once\\nmore.\\n\\nWhen I consulted the chart an hour later, I saw that the Nautilus’s\\nposition was marked at longitude 16 degrees 17’ and latitude 33\\ndegrees 22’, a good 150 leagues from the nearest coast. It wouldn’t do\\nto even dream of escaping, and I’ll let the reader decide how promptly\\nthe Canadian threw a tantrum when I ventured to tell him our\\nsituation.\\n\\nAs for me, I wasn’t exactly grief-stricken. I felt as if a heavy\\nweight had been lifted from me, and I was able to resume my regular\\ntasks in a state of comparative calm.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the evening, I received a most unexpected visit\\nfrom Captain Nemo. He asked me very graciously if I felt exhausted\\nfrom our vigil the night before. I said no.\\n\\n“Then, Professor Aronnax, I propose an unusual excursion.”\\n\\n“Propose away, captain.”\\n\\n“So far you’ve visited the ocean depths only by day and under\\nsunlight. Would you like to see these depths on a dark night?”\\n\\n“Very much.”\\n\\n“I warn you, this will be an exhausting stroll. We’ll need to walk\\nlong hours and scale a mountain. The roads aren’t terribly well kept\\nup.”\\n\\n“Everything you say, captain, just increases my curiosity. I’m ready\\nto go with you.”\\n\\n“Then come along, professor, and we’ll go put on our diving suits.”\\n\\nArriving at the wardrobe, I saw that neither my companions nor any\\ncrewmen would be coming with us on this excursion. Captain Nemo hadn’t\\neven suggested my fetching Ned or Conseil.\\n\\nIn a few moments we had put on our equipment. Air tanks, abundantly\\ncharged, were placed on our backs, but the electric lamps were not in\\nreadiness. I commented on this to the captain.\\n\\n“They’ll be useless to us,” he replied.\\n\\nI thought I hadn’t heard him right, but I couldn’t repeat my comment\\nbecause the captain’s head had already disappeared into its metal\\ncovering. I finished harnessing myself, I felt an alpenstock being\\nplaced in my hand, and a few minutes later, after the usual\\nprocedures, we set foot on the floor of the Atlantic, 300 meters down.\\n\\nMidnight was approaching. The waters were profoundly dark, but Captain\\nNemo pointed to a reddish spot in the distance, a sort of wide glow\\nshimmering about two miles from the Nautilus. What this fire was, what\\nsubstances fed it, how and why it kept burning in the liquid mass, I\\ncouldn’t say. Anyhow it lit our way, although hazily, but I soon grew\\naccustomed to this unique gloom, and in these circumstances I\\nunderstood the uselessness of the Ruhmkorff device.\\n\\nSide by side, Captain Nemo and I walked directly toward this\\nconspicuous flame. The level seafloor rose imperceptibly. We took long\\nstrides, helped by our alpenstocks; but in general our progress was\\nslow, because our feet kept sinking into a kind of slimy mud mixed\\nwith seaweed and assorted flat stones.\\n\\nAs we moved forward, I heard a kind of pitter-patter above my\\nhead. Sometimes this noise increased and became a continuous\\ncrackle. I soon realized the cause. It was a heavy rainfall rattling\\non the surface of the waves. Instinctively I worried that I might get\\nsoaked! By water in the midst of water! I couldn’t help smiling at\\nthis outlandish notion. But to tell the truth, wearing these heavy\\ndiving suits, you no longer feel the liquid element, you simply think\\nyou’re in the midst of air a little denser than air on land, that’s\\nall.\\n\\nAfter half an hour of walking, the seafloor grew rocky. Jellyfish,\\nmicroscopic crustaceans, and sea-pen coral lit it faintly with their\\nphosphorescent glimmers. I glimpsed piles of stones covered by a\\ncouple million zoophytes and tangles of algae. My feet often slipped\\non this viscous seaweed carpet, and without my alpenstock I would have\\nfallen more than once. When I turned around, I could still see the\\nNautilus’s whitish beacon, which was starting to grow pale in the\\ndistance.\\n\\nThose piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor\\nwith a distinct but inexplicable symmetry. I spotted gigantic furrows\\ntrailing off into the distant darkness, their length\\nincalculable. There also were other peculiarities I couldn’t make\\nsense of. It seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a\\nlitter of bones that made a dry crackling noise. So what were these\\nvast plains we were now crossing? I wanted to ask the captain, but I\\nstill didn’t grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with\\nhis companions when they went with him on his underwater excursions.\\n\\nMeanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed the\\nhorizon. The presence of this furnace under the waters had me\\nextremely puzzled. Was it some sort of electrical discharge? Was I\\napproaching some natural phenomenon still unknown to scientists on\\nshore? Or, rather (and this thought did cross my mind), had the hand\\nof man intervened in that blaze? Had human beings fanned those flames?\\nIn these deep strata would I meet up with more of Captain Nemo’s\\ncompanions, friends he was about to visit who led lives as strange as\\nhis own? Would I find a whole colony of exiles down here, men tired of\\nthe world’s woes, men who had sought and found independence in the\\nocean’s lower depths? All these insane, inadmissible ideas dogged me,\\nand in this frame of mind, continually excited by the series of\\nwonders passing before my eyes, I wouldn’t have been surprised to find\\non this sea bottom one of those underwater towns Captain Nemo dreamed\\nabout!\\n\\nOur path was getting brighter and brighter. The red glow had turned\\nwhite and was radiating from a mountain peak about 800 feet high. But\\nwhat I saw was simply a reflection produced by the crystal waters of\\nthese strata. The furnace that was the source of this inexplicable\\nlight occupied the far side of the mountain.\\n\\nIn the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this Atlantic seafloor,\\nCaptain Nemo moved forward without hesitation. He knew this dark\\npath. No doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing\\nhis way. I followed him with unshakeable confidence. He seemed like\\nsome Spirit of the Sea, and as he walked ahead of me, I marveled at\\nhis tall figure, which stood out in black against the glowing\\nbackground of the horizon.\\n\\nIt was one o’clock in the morning. We arrived at the mountain’s lower\\ngradients. But in grappling with them, we had to venture up difficult\\ntrails through a huge thicket.\\n\\nYes, a thicket of dead trees! Trees without leaves, without sap,\\nturned to stone by the action of the waters, and crowned here and\\nthere by gigantic pines. It was like a still-erect coalfield, its\\nroots clutching broken soil, its boughs clearly outlined against the\\nceiling of the waters like thin, black, paper cutouts. Picture a\\nforest clinging to the sides of a peak in the Harz Mountains, but a\\nsubmerged forest. The trails were cluttered with algae and fucus\\nplants, hosts of crustaceans swarming among them. I plunged on,\\nscaling rocks, straddling fallen tree trunks, snapping marine creepers\\nthat swayed from one tree to another, startling the fish that flitted\\nfrom branch to branch. Carried away, I didn’t feel exhausted any\\nmore. I followed a guide who was immune to exhaustion.\\n\\nWhat a sight! How can I describe it! How can I portray these woods and\\nrocks in this liquid setting, their lower parts dark and sullen, their\\nupper parts tinted red in this light whose intensity was doubled by\\nthe reflecting power of the waters! We scaled rocks that crumbled\\nbehind us, collapsing in enormous sections with the hollow rumble of\\nan avalanche. To our right and left there were carved gloomy galleries\\nwhere the eye lost its way. Huge glades opened up, seemingly cleared\\nby the hand of man, and I sometimes wondered whether some residents of\\nthese underwater regions would suddenly appear before me.\\n\\nBut Captain Nemo kept climbing. I didn’t want to fall behind. I\\nfollowed him boldly. My alpenstock was a great help. One wrong step\\nwould have been disastrous on the narrow paths cut into the sides of\\nthese chasms, but I walked along with a firm tread and without the\\nslightest feeling of dizziness. Sometimes I leaped over a crevasse\\nwhose depth would have made me recoil had I been in the midst of\\nglaciers on shore; sometimes I ventured out on a wobbling tree trunk\\nfallen across a gorge, without looking down, having eyes only for\\nmarveling at the wild scenery of this region. There, leaning on\\nerratically cut foundations, monumental rocks seemed to defy the laws\\nof balance. From between their stony knees, trees sprang up like jets\\nunder fearsome pressure, supporting other trees that supported them in\\nturn. Next, natural towers with wide, steeply carved battlements\\nleaned at angles that, on dry land, the laws of gravity would never\\nhave authorized.\\n\\nAnd I too could feel the difference created by the water’s powerful\\ndensity—despite my heavy clothing, copper headpiece, and metal soles,\\nI climbed the most impossibly steep gradients with all the nimbleness,\\nI swear it, of a chamois or a Pyrenees mountain goat!\\n\\nAs for my account of this excursion under the waters, I’m well aware\\nthat it sounds incredible! I’m the chronicler of deeds seemingly\\nimpossible and yet incontestably real. This was no fantasy. This was\\nwhat I saw and felt!\\n\\nTwo hours after leaving the Nautilus, we had cleared the timberline,\\nand 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak, forming a dark\\nsilhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far\\nslope. Petrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling\\nzigzags. Fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall\\ngrass. The rocky mass was gouged with impenetrable crevices, deep\\ncaves, unfathomable holes at whose far ends I could hear fearsome\\nthings moving around. My blood would curdle as I watched some enormous\\nantenna bar my path, or saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the\\nshadow of some cavity! A thousand specks of light glittered in the\\nmidst of the gloom. They were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans\\ncrouching in their lairs, giant lobsters rearing up like spear\\ncarriers and moving their claws with a scrap-iron clanking, titanic\\ncrabs aiming their bodies like cannons on their carriages, and hideous\\ndevilfish intertwining their tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes.\\n\\nWhat was this astounding world that I didn’t yet know? In what order\\ndid these articulates belong, these creatures for which the rocks\\nprovided a second carapace? Where had nature learned the secret of\\ntheir vegetating existence, and for how many centuries had they lived\\nin the ocean’s lower strata?\\n\\nBut I couldn’t linger. Captain Nemo, on familiar terms with these\\ndreadful animals, no longer minded them. We arrived at a preliminary\\nplateau where still other surprises were waiting for me. There\\npicturesque ruins took shape, betraying the hand of man, not our\\nCreator. They were huge stacks of stones in which you could\\ndistinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples, now arrayed\\nin hosts of blossoming zoophytes, and over it all, not ivy but a heavy\\nmantle of algae and fucus plants.\\n\\nBut what part of the globe could this be, this land swallowed by\\ncataclysms? Who had set up these rocks and stones like the dolmens of\\nprehistoric times? Where was I, where had Captain Nemo’s fancies taken\\nme?\\n\\nI wanted to ask him. Unable to, I stopped him. I seized his arm. But\\nhe shook his head, pointed to the mountain’s topmost peak, and seemed\\nto tell me:\\n\\n“Come on! Come with me! Come higher!”\\n\\nI followed him with one last burst of energy, and in a few minutes I\\nhad scaled the peak, which crowned the whole rocky mass by some ten\\nmeters.\\n\\nI looked back down the side we had just cleared. There the mountain\\nrose only 700 to 800 feet above the plains; but on its far slope it\\ncrowned the receding bottom of this part of the Atlantic by a height\\ntwice that. My eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit\\nby intense flashes of light. In essence, this mountain was a\\nvolcano. Fifty feet below its peak, amid a shower of stones and slag,\\na wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in fiery\\ncascades into the heart of the liquid mass. So situated, this volcano\\nwas an immense torch that lit up the lower plains all the way to the\\nhorizon.\\n\\nAs I said, this underwater crater spewed lava, but not flames. Flames\\nneed oxygen from the air and are unable to spread underwater; but a\\nlava flow, which contains in itself the principle of its\\nincandescence, can rise to a white heat, overpower the liquid element,\\nand turn it into steam on contact. Swift currents swept away all this\\ndiffuse gas, and torrents of lava slid to the foot of the mountain,\\nlike the disgorgings of a Mt. Vesuvius over the city limits of a\\nsecond Torre del Greco.\\n\\nIn fact, there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins, demolished,\\noverwhelmed, laid low, its roofs caved in, its temples pulled down,\\nits arches dislocated, its columns stretching over the earth; in these\\nruins you could still detect the solid proportions of a sort of Tuscan\\narchitecture; farther off, the remains of a gigantic aqueduct; here,\\nthe caked heights of an acropolis along with the fluid forms of a\\nParthenon; there, the remnants of a wharf, as if some bygone port had\\nlong ago harbored merchant vessels and triple-tiered war galleys on\\nthe shores of some lost ocean; still farther off, long rows of\\ncollapsing walls, deserted thoroughfares, a whole Pompeii buried under\\nthe waters, which Captain Nemo had resurrected before my eyes!\\n\\nWhere was I? Where was I? I had to find out at all cost, I wanted to\\nspeak, I wanted to rip off the copper sphere imprisoning my head.\\n\\nBut Captain Nemo came over and stopped me with a gesture. Then,\\npicking up a piece of chalky stone, he advanced to a black basaltic\\nrock and scrawled this one word:\\n\\nATLANTIS\\n\\nWhat lightning flashed through my mind! Atlantis, that ancient land of\\nMeropis mentioned by the historian Theopompus; Plato’s Atlantis; the\\ncontinent whose very existence has been denied by such philosophers\\nand scientists as Origen, Porphyry, Iamblichus, d’Anville, Malte-Brun,\\nand Humboldt, who entered its disappearance in the ledger of myths and\\nfolk tales; the country whose reality has nevertheless been accepted\\nby such other thinkers as Posidonius, Pliny, Ammianus Marcellinus,\\nTertullian, Engel, Scherer, Tournefort, Buffon, and d’Avezac; I had\\nthis land right under my eyes, furnishing its own unimpeachable\\nevidence of the catastrophe that had overtaken it! So this was the\\nsubmerged region that had existed outside Europe, Asia, and Libya,\\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules, home of those powerful Atlantean\\npeople against whom ancient Greece had waged its earliest wars!\\n\\nThe writer whose narratives record the lofty deeds of those heroic\\ntimes is Plato himself. His dialogues Timaeus and Critias were drafted\\nwith the poet and legislator Solon as their inspiration, as it were.\\n\\nOne day Solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the\\nEgyptian capital of Sais, a town already 8,000 years of age, as\\ndocumented by the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its\\ntemples. One of these elders related the history of another town 1,000\\nyears older still. This original city of Athens, ninety centuries old,\\nhad been invaded and partly destroyed by the Atlanteans. These\\nAtlanteans, he said, resided on an immense continent greater than\\nAfrica and\\n\\nAsia combined, taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees\\nand 40 degrees north. Their dominion extended even to Egypt. They\\ntried to enforce their rule as far as Greece, but they had to retreat\\nbefore the indomitable resistance of the Hellenic people. Centuries\\npassed. A cataclysm occurred—floods, earthquakes. A single night and\\nday were enough to obliterate this Atlantis, whose highest peaks\\n(Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries, the Cape Verde Islands) still\\nemerge above the waves.\\n\\nThese were the historical memories that Captain Nemo’s scrawl sent\\nrushing through my mind. Thus, led by the strangest of fates, I was\\ntreading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent! My hands\\nwere touching ruins many thousands of years old, contemporary with\\nprehistoric times! I was walking in the very place where\\ncontemporaries of early man had walked! My heavy soles were crushing\\nthe skeletons of animals from the age of fable, animals that used to\\ntake cover in the shade of these trees now turned to stone!\\n\\nOh, why was I so short of time! I would have gone down the steep\\nslopes of this mountain, crossed this entire immense continent, which\\nsurely connects Africa with America, and visited its great prehistoric\\ncities. Under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike town of Makhimos\\nor the pious village of Eusebes, whose gigantic inhabitants lived for\\nwhole centuries and had the strength to raise blocks of stone that\\nstill withstood the action of the waters. One day perhaps, some\\nvolcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken ruins back to the surface\\nof the waves! Numerous underwater volcanoes have been sighted in this\\npart of the ocean, and many ships have felt terrific tremors when\\npassing over these turbulent depths. A few have heard hollow noises\\nthat announced some struggle of the elements far below, others have\\nhauled in volcanic ash hurled above the waves. As far as the equator\\nthis whole seafloor is still under construction by plutonic\\nforces. And in some remote epoch, built up by volcanic disgorgings and\\nsuccessive layers of lava, who knows whether the peaks of these\\nfire-belching mountains may reappear above the surface of the\\nAtlantic!\\n\\nAs I mused in this way, trying to establish in my memory every detail\\nof this impressive landscape, Captain Nemo was leaning his elbows on a\\nmoss-covered monument, motionless as if petrified in some mute\\ntrance. Was he dreaming of those lost generations, asking them for the\\nsecret of human destiny? Was it here that this strange man came to\\nrevive himself, basking in historical memories, reliving that bygone\\nlife, he who had no desire for our modern one? I would have given\\nanything to know his thoughts, to share them, understand them!\\n\\nWe stayed in this place an entire hour, contemplating its vast plains\\nin the lava’s glow, which sometimes took on a startling\\nintensity. Inner boilings sent quick shivers running through the\\nmountain’s crust. Noises from deep underneath, clearly transmitted by\\nthe liquid medium, reverberated with majestic amplitude.\\n\\nJust then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass,\\ncasting a few pale rays over this submerged continent. It was only a\\nfleeting glimmer, but its effect was indescribable. The captain stood\\nup and took one last look at these immense plains; then his hand\\nsignaled me to follow him.\\n\\nWe went swiftly down the mountain. Once past the petrified forest, I\\ncould see the Nautilus’s beacon twinkling like a star. The captain\\nwalked straight toward it, and we were back on board just as the first\\nglimmers of dawn were whitening the surface of the ocean.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\nThe Underwater Coalfields\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY, February 20, I overslept. I was so exhausted from the\\nnight before, I didn’t get up until eleven o’clock. I dressed\\nquickly. I hurried to find out the Nautilus’s heading. The instruments\\nindicated that it was running southward at a speed of twenty miles per\\nhour and a depth of 100 meters.\\n\\nConseil entered. I described our nocturnal excursion to him, and since\\nthe panels were open, he could still catch a glimpse of this submerged\\ncontinent.\\n\\nIn fact, the Nautilus was skimming only ten meters over the soil of\\nthese Atlantis plains. The ship scudded along like an air balloon\\nborne by the wind over some prairie on land; but it would be more\\naccurate to say that we sat in the lounge as if we were riding in a\\ncoach on an express train. As for the foregrounds passing before our\\neyes, they were fantastically carved rocks, forests of trees that had\\ncrossed over from the vegetable kingdom into the mineral kingdom,\\ntheir motionless silhouettes sprawling beneath the waves. There also\\nwere stony masses buried beneath carpets of axidia and sea anemone,\\nbristling with long, vertical water plants, then strangely contoured\\nblocks of lava that testified to all the fury of those plutonic\\ndevelopments.\\n\\nWhile this bizarre scenery was glittering under our electric beams, I\\ntold Conseil the story of the Atlanteans, who had inspired the old\\nFrench scientist Jean Bailly to write so many entertaining—albeit\\nutterly fictitious—pages.* I told the lad about the wars of these\\nheroic people. I discussed the question of Atlantis with the fervor of\\na man who no longer had any doubts. But Conseil was so distracted he\\nbarely heard me, and his lack of interest in any commentary on this\\nhistorical topic was soon explained.\\n\\n*Bailly believed that Atlantis was located at the North Pole! Ed.\\n\\nIn essence, numerous fish had caught his eye, and when fish pass by,\\nConseil vanishes into his world of classifying and leaves real life\\nbehind. In which case I could only tag along and resume our\\nichthyological research.\\n\\nEven so, these Atlantic fish were not noticeably different from those\\nwe had observed earlier. There were rays of gigantic size, five meters\\nlong and with muscles so powerful they could leap above the waves,\\nsharks of various species including a fifteen-foot glaucous shark with\\nsharp triangular teeth and so transparent it was almost invisible amid\\nthe waters, brown lantern sharks, prism-shaped humantin sharks armored\\nwith protuberant hides, sturgeons resembling their relatives in the\\nMediterranean, trumpet-snouted pipefish a foot and a half long,\\nyellowish brown with small gray fins and no teeth or tongue, unreeling\\nlike slim, supple snakes.\\n\\nAmong bony fish, Conseil noticed some blackish marlin three meters\\nlong with a sharp sword jutting from the upper jaw, bright-colored\\nweevers known in Aristotle’s day as sea dragons and whose dorsal\\nstingers make them quite dangerous to pick up, then dolphinfish with\\nbrown backs striped in blue and edged in gold, handsome dorados,\\nmoonlike opahs that look like azure disks but which the sun’s rays\\nturn into spots of silver, finally eight-meter swordfish from the\\ngenus Xiphias, swimming in schools, sporting yellowish sickle-shaped\\nfins and six-foot broadswords, stalwart animals, plant eaters rather\\nthan fish eaters, obeying the tiniest signals from their females like\\nhenpecked husbands.\\n\\nBut while observing these different specimens of marine fauna, I\\ndidn’t stop examining the long plains of Atlantis. Sometimes an\\nunpredictable irregularity in the seafloor would force the Nautilus to\\nslow down, and then it would glide into the narrow channels between\\nthe hills with a cetacean’s dexterity. If the labyrinth became\\nhopelessly tangled, the submersible would rise above it like an\\nairship, and after clearing the obstacle, it would resume its speedy\\ncourse just a few meters above the ocean floor. It was an enjoyable\\nand impressive way of navigating that did indeed recall the maneuvers\\nof an airship ride, with the major difference that the Nautilus\\nfaithfully obeyed the hands of its helmsman.\\n\\nThe terrain consisted mostly of thick slime mixed with petrified\\nbranches, but it changed little by little near four o’clock in the\\nafternoon; it grew rockier and seemed to be strewn with pudding stones\\nand a basaltic gravel called “tuff,” together with bits of lava and\\nsulfurous obsidian. I expected these long plains to change into\\nmountain regions, and in fact, as the Nautilus was executing certain\\nturns, I noticed that the southerly horizon was blocked by a high wall\\nthat seemed to close off every exit. Its summit obviously poked above\\nthe level of the ocean. It had to be a continent or at least an\\nisland, either one of the Canaries or one of the Cape Verde\\nIslands. Our bearings hadn’t been marked on the chart—perhaps\\ndeliberately—and I had no idea what our position was. In any case this\\nwall seemed to signal the end of Atlantis, of which, all in all, we\\nhad crossed only a small part.\\n\\nNightfall didn’t interrupt my observations. I was left to\\nmyself. Conseil had repaired to his cabin. The Nautilus slowed down,\\nhovering above the muddled masses on the seafloor, sometimes grazing\\nthem as if wanting to come to rest, sometimes rising unpredictably to\\nthe surface of the waves. Then I glimpsed a few bright constellations\\nthrough the crystal waters, specifically five or six of those zodiacal\\nstars trailing from the tail end of Orion.\\n\\nI would have stayed longer at my window, marveling at these beauties\\nof sea and sky, but the panels closed. Just then the Nautilus had\\narrived at the perpendicular face of that high wall. How the ship\\nwould maneuver I hadn’t a guess. I repaired to my stateroom. The\\nNautilus did not stir. I fell asleep with the firm intention of waking\\nup in just a few hours.\\n\\nBut it was eight o’clock the next day when I returned to the lounge. I\\nstared at the pressure gauge. It told me that the Nautilus was afloat\\non the surface of the ocean. Furthermore, I heard the sound of\\nfootsteps on the platform. Yet there were no rolling movements to\\nindicate the presence of waves undulating above me.\\n\\nI climbed as far as the hatch. It was open. But instead of the broad\\ndaylight I was expecting, I found that I was surrounded by total\\ndarkness. Where were we? Had I been mistaken? Was it still night? No!\\nNot one star was twinkling, and nighttime is never so utterly black.\\n\\nI wasn’t sure what to think, when a voice said to me:\\n\\n“Is that you, professor?”\\n\\n“Ah, Captain Nemo!” I replied. “Where are we?”\\n\\n“Underground, professor.”\\n\\n“Underground!” I exclaimed. “And the Nautilus is still floating?”\\n\\n“It always floats.”\\n\\n“But I don’t understand!”\\n\\n“Wait a little while. Our beacon is about to go on, and if you want\\nsome light on the subject, you’ll be satisfied.”\\n\\nI set foot on the platform and waited. The darkness was so profound I\\ncouldn’t see even Captain Nemo. However, looking at the zenith\\ndirectly overhead, I thought I caught sight of a feeble glimmer, a\\nsort of twilight filtering through a circular hole. Just then the\\nbeacon suddenly went on, and its intense brightness made that hazy\\nlight vanish.\\n\\nThis stream of electricity dazzled my eyes, and after momentarily\\nshutting them, I looked around. The Nautilus was stationary. It was\\nfloating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf. As for the water\\nnow buoying the ship, it was a lake completely encircled by an inner\\nwall about two miles in diameter, hence six miles around. Its level—as\\nindicated by the pressure gauge—would be the same as the outside\\nlevel, because some connection had to exist between this lake and the\\nsea. Slanting inward over their base, these high walls converged to\\nform a vault shaped like an immense upside-down funnel that measured\\n500 or 600 meters in height. At its summit there gaped the circular\\nopening through which I had detected that faint glimmer, obviously\\ndaylight.\\n\\nBefore more carefully examining the interior features of this enormous\\ncavern, and before deciding if it was the work of nature or humankind,\\nI went over to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“Where are we?” I said.\\n\\n“In the very heart of an extinct volcano,” the captain answered me, “a\\nvolcano whose interior was invaded by the sea after some convulsion in\\nthe earth. While you were sleeping, professor, the Nautilus entered\\nthis lagoon through a natural channel that opens ten meters below the\\nsurface of the ocean. This is our home port, secure, convenient,\\nsecret, and sheltered against winds from any direction! Along the\\ncoasts of your continents or islands, show me any offshore mooring\\nthat can equal this safe refuge for withstanding the fury of\\nhurricanes.”\\n\\n“Indeed,” I replied, “here you’re in perfect safety, Captain Nemo. Who\\ncould reach you in the heart of a volcano? But don’t I see an opening\\nat its summit?”\\n\\n“Yes, its crater, a crater formerly filled with lava, steam, and\\nflames, but which now lets in this life-giving air we’re breathing.”\\n\\n“But which volcanic mountain is this?” I asked.\\n\\n“It’s one of the many islets with which this sea is strewn. For ships\\na mere reef, for us an immense cavern. I discovered it by chance, and\\nchance served me well.”\\n\\n“But couldn’t someone enter through the mouth of its crater?”\\n\\n“No more than I could exit through it. You can climb about 100 feet up\\nthe inner base of this mountain, but then the walls overhang, they\\nlean too far in to be scaled.”\\n\\n“I can see, captain, that nature is your obedient servant, any time or\\nany place. You’re safe on this lake, and nobody else can visit its\\nwaters. But what’s the purpose of this refuge? The Nautilus doesn’t\\nneed a harbor.”\\n\\n“No, professor, but it needs electricity to run, batteries to generate\\nits electricity, sodium to feed its batteries, coal to make its\\nsodium, and coalfields from which to dig its coal. Now then, right at\\nthis spot the sea covers entire forests that sank underwater in\\nprehistoric times; today, turned to stone, transformed into carbon\\nfuel, they offer me inexhaustible coal mines.”\\n\\n“So, captain, your men practice the trade of miners here?”\\n\\n“Precisely. These mines extend under the waves like the coalfields at\\nNewcastle. Here, dressed in diving suits, pick and mattock in hand, my\\nmen go out and dig this carbon fuel for which I don’t need a single\\nmine on land. When I burn this combustible to produce sodium, the\\nsmoke escaping from the mountain’s crater gives it the appearance of a\\nstill-active volcano.”\\n\\n“And will we see your companions at work?”\\n\\n“No, at least not this time, because I’m eager to continue our\\nunderwater tour of the world. Accordingly, I’ll rest content with\\ndrawing on my reserve stock of sodium. We’ll stay here long enough to\\nload it on board, in other words, a single workday, then we’ll resume\\nour voyage. So, Professor Aronnax, if you’d like to explore this\\ncavern and circle its lagoon, seize the day.”\\n\\nI thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions, who\\nhadn’t yet left their cabin. I invited them to follow me, not telling\\nthem where we were.\\n\\nThey climbed onto the platform. Conseil, whom nothing could startle,\\nsaw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves and\\nwake up under a mountain. But Ned Land had no idea in his head other\\nthan to see if this cavern offered some way out.\\n\\nAfter breakfast near ten o’clock, we went down onto the embankment.\\n\\n“So here we are, back on shore,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“I’d hardly call this shore,” the Canadian replied. “And besides, we\\naren’t on it but under it.”\\n\\nA sandy beach unfolded before us, measuring 500 feet at its widest\\npoint between the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain’s\\nwalls. Via this strand you could easily circle the lake. But the base\\nof these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay\\npicturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones. All\\nthese crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by the\\naction of underground fires, and they glistened under the stream of\\nelectric light from our beacon. Stirred up by our footsteps, the\\nmica-rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a cloud of sparks.\\n\\nThe ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats by\\nthe waves, and we soon arrived at some long, winding gradients,\\ngenuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little; but\\nwe had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that weren’t\\ncemented together, and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte, made\\nof feldspar and quartz crystals.\\n\\nThe volcanic nature of this enormous pit was apparent all around us. I\\nventured to comment on it to my companions.\\n\\n“Can you picture,” I asked them, “what this funnel must have been like\\nwhen it was filled with boiling lava, and the level of that\\nincandescent liquid rose right to the mountain’s mouth, like cast iron\\nup the insides of a furnace?”\\n\\n“I can picture it perfectly,” Conseil replied. “But will master tell\\nme why this huge smelter suspended operations, and how it is that an\\noven was replaced by the tranquil waters of a lake?”\\n\\n“In all likelihood, Conseil, because some convulsion created an\\nopening below the surface of the ocean, the opening that serves as a\\npassageway for the Nautilus. Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed\\ninside the mountain. There ensued a dreadful struggle between the\\nelements of fire and water, a struggle ending in King Neptune’s\\nfavor. But many centuries have passed since then, and this submerged\\nvolcano has changed into a peaceful cavern.”\\n\\n“That’s fine,” Ned Land answered. “I accept the explanation, but in\\nour personal interests, I’m sorry this opening the professor mentions\\nwasn’t made above sea level.”\\n\\n“But Ned my friend,” Conseil answered, “if it weren’t an underwater\\npassageway, the Nautilus couldn’t enter it!”\\n\\n“And I might add, Mr. Land,” I said, “that the waters wouldn’t have\\nrushed under the mountain, and the volcano would still be a\\nvolcano. So you have nothing to be sorry about.”\\n\\nOur climb continued. The gradients got steeper and narrower. Sometimes\\nthey were cut across by deep pits that had to be cleared. Masses of\\noverhanging rock had to be gotten around. You slid on your knees, you\\ncrept on your belly. But helped by the Canadian’s strength and\\nConseil’s dexterity, we overcame every obstacle.\\n\\nAt an elevation of about thirty meters, the nature of the terrain\\nchanged without becoming any easier. Pudding stones and trachyte gave\\nway to black basaltic rock: here, lying in slabs all swollen with\\nblisters; there, shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a series\\nof columns that supported the springings of this immense vault, a\\nwonderful sample of natural architecture. Then, among this basaltic\\nrock, there snaked long, hardened lava flows inlaid with veins of\\nbituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur. The\\nsunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger, shedding a hazy\\nlight over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this\\nextinct mountain.\\n\\nBut when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet, we were\\nstopped by insurmountable obstacles. The converging inside walls\\nchanged into overhangs, and our climb into a circular stroll. At this\\ntopmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge the mineral\\nkingdom. Shrubs, and even a few trees, emerged from crevices in the\\nwalls. I recognized some spurges that let their caustic, purgative sap\\ntrickle out. There were heliotropes, very remiss at living up to their\\nsun-worshipping reputations since no sunlight ever reached them; their\\nclusters of flowers drooped sadly, their colors and scents were\\nfaded. Here and there chrysanthemums sprouted timidly at the feet of\\naloes with long, sad, sickly leaves. But between these lava flows I\\nspotted little violets that still gave off a subtle fragrance, and I\\nconfess that I inhaled it with delight. The soul of a flower is its\\nscent, and those splendid water plants, flowers of the sea, have no\\nsouls!\\n\\nWe had arrived at the foot of a sturdy clump of dragon trees, which\\nwere splitting the rocks with exertions of their muscular roots, when\\nNed Land exclaimed:\\n\\n“Oh, sir, a hive!”\\n\\n“A hive?” I answered, with a gesture of utter disbelief.\\n\\n“Yes, a hive,” the Canadian repeated, “with bees buzzing around!”\\n\\nI went closer and was forced to recognize the obvious. At the mouth of\\na hole cut in the trunk of a dragon tree, there swarmed thousands of\\nthese ingenious insects so common to all the Canary Islands, where\\ntheir output is especially prized.\\n\\nNaturally enough, the Canadian wanted to lay in a supply of honey, and\\nit would have been ill-mannered of me to say no. He mixed sulfur with\\nsome dry leaves, set them on fire with a spark from his tinderbox, and\\nproceeded to smoke the bees out. Little by little the buzzing died\\ndown and the disemboweled hive yielded several pounds of sweet\\nhoney. Ned Land stuffed his haversack with it.\\n\\n“When I’ve mixed this honey with our breadfruit batter,” he told us,\\n“I’ll be ready to serve you a delectable piece of cake.”\\n\\n“But of course,” Conseil put in, “it will be gingerbread!”\\n\\n“I’m all for gingerbread,” I said, “but let’s resume this fascinating\\nstroll.”\\n\\nAt certain turns in the trail we were going along, the lake appeared\\nin its full expanse. The ship’s beacon lit up that whole placid\\nsurface, which experienced neither ripples nor undulations. The\\nNautilus lay perfectly still. On its platform and on the embankment,\\ncrewmen were bustling around, black shadows that stood out clearly in\\nthe midst of the luminous air.\\n\\nJust then we went around the highest ridge of these rocky foothills\\nthat supported the vault. Then I saw that bees weren’t the animal\\nkingdom’s only representatives inside this volcano. Here and in the\\nshadows, birds of prey soared and whirled, flying away from nests\\nperched on tips of rock. There were sparrow hawks with white bellies,\\nand screeching kestrels. With all the speed their stiltlike legs could\\nmuster, fine fat bustards scampered over the slopes. I’ll let the\\nreader decide whether the Canadian’s appetite was aroused by the sight\\nof this tasty game, and whether he regretted having no rifle in his\\nhands. He tried to make stones do the work of bullets, and after\\nseveral fruitless attempts, he managed to wound one of these\\nmagnificent bustards. To say he risked his life twenty times in order\\nto capture this bird is simply the unadulterated truth; but he fared\\nso well, the animal went into his sack to join the honeycombs.\\n\\nBy then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge\\nhad become impossible. Above us, the yawning crater looked like the\\nwide mouth of a well. From where we stood, the sky was pretty easy to\\nsee, and I watched clouds race by, disheveled by the west wind,\\nletting tatters of mist trail over the mountain’s summit. Proof\\npositive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude, because this\\nvolcano didn’t rise more than 1,800 feet above the level of the ocean.\\n\\nHalf an hour after the Canadian’s latest exploits, we were back on the\\ninner beach. There the local flora was represented by a wide carpet of\\nsamphire, a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely, which\\nalso boasts the names glasswort, saxifrage, and sea fennel. Conseil\\npicked a couple bunches. As for the local fauna, it included thousands\\nof crustaceans of every type: lobsters, hermit crabs, prawns, mysid\\nshrimps, daddy longlegs, rock crabs, and a prodigious number of\\nseashells, such as cowries, murex snails, and limpets.\\n\\nIn this locality there gaped the mouth of a magnificent cave. My\\ncompanions and I took great pleasure in stretching out on its\\nfine-grained sand. Fire had polished the sparkling enamel of its inner\\nwalls, sprinkled all over with mica-rich dust. Ned Land tapped these\\nwalls and tried to probe their thickness. I couldn’t help smiling. Our\\nconversation then turned to his everlasting escape plans, and without\\ngoing too far, I felt I could offer him this hope: Captain Nemo had\\ngone down south only to replenish his sodium supplies. So I hoped he\\nwould now hug the coasts of Europe and America, which would allow the\\nCanadian to try again with a greater chance of success.\\n\\nWe were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour. Our\\nconversation, lively at the outset, then languished. A definite\\ndrowsiness overcame us. Since I saw no good reason to resist the call\\nof sleep, I fell into a heavy doze. I dreamed—one doesn’t choose his\\ndreams—that my life had been reduced to the vegetating existence of a\\nsimple mollusk. It seemed to me that this cave made up my\\ndouble-valved shell. . . .\\n\\nSuddenly Conseil’s voice startled me awake.\\n\\n“Get up! Get up!” shouted the fine lad.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked, in a sitting position.\\n\\n“The water’s coming up to us!”\\n\\nI got back on my feet. Like a torrent the sea was rushing into our\\nretreat, and since we definitely were not mollusks, we had to clear\\nout.\\n\\nIn a few seconds we were safe on top of the cave.\\n\\n“What happened?” Conseil asked. “Some new phenomenon?”\\n\\n“Not quite, my friends!” I replied. “It was the tide, merely the tide,\\nwhich wellnigh caught us by surprise just as it did Sir Walter Scott’s\\nhero! The ocean outside is rising, and by a perfectly natural law of\\nbalance, the level of this lake is also rising. We’ve gotten off with\\na mild dunking. Let’s go change clothes on the Nautilus.”\\n\\nThree-quarters of an hour later, we had completed our circular stroll\\nand were back on board. Just then the crewmen finished loading the\\nsodium supplies, and the Nautilus could have departed immediately.\\n\\nBut Captain Nemo gave no orders. Would he wait for nightfall and exit\\nthrough his underwater passageway in secrecy? Perhaps.\\n\\nBe that as it may, by the next day the Nautilus had left its home port\\nand was navigating well out from any shore, a few meters beneath the\\nwaves of the Atlantic.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\nThe Sargasso Sea\\n\\n\\nTHE NAUTILUS didn’t change direction. For the time being, then, we had\\nto set aside any hope of returning to European seas. Captain Nemo kept\\nhis prow pointing south. Where was he taking us? I was afraid to\\nguess.\\n\\nThat day the Nautilus crossed an odd part of the Atlantic Ocean. No\\none is unaware of the existence of that great warm-water current known\\nby name as the Gulf Stream. After emerging from channels off Florida,\\nit heads toward Spitzbergen. But before entering the Gulf of Mexico\\nnear latitude 44 degrees north, this current divides into two arms;\\nits chief arm makes for the shores of Ireland and Norway while the\\nsecond flexes southward at the level of the Azores; then it hits the\\ncoast of Africa, sweeps in a long oval, and returns to the Caribbean\\nSea.\\n\\nNow then, this second arm—more accurately, a collar—forms a ring of\\nwarm water around a section of cool, tranquil, motionless ocean called\\nthe Sargasso Sea. This is an actual lake in the open Atlantic, and the\\ngreat current’s waters take at least three years to circle it.\\n\\nProperly speaking, the Sargasso Sea covers every submerged part of\\nAtlantis. Certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn\\nover this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient\\ncontinent. But it’s more likely that these grasses, algae, and fucus\\nplants were carried off from the beaches of Europe and America, then\\ntaken as far as this zone by the Gulf Stream. This is one of the\\nreasons why Christopher Columbus assumed the existence of a New\\nWorld. When the ships of that bold investigator arrived in the\\nSargasso Sea, they had great difficulty navigating in the midst of\\nthese weeds, which, much to their crews’ dismay, slowed them down to a\\nhalt; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector.\\n\\nSuch was the region our Nautilus was visiting just then: a genuine\\nprairie, a tightly woven carpet of algae, gulfweed, and bladder wrack\\nso dense and compact a craft’s stempost couldn’t tear through it\\nwithout difficulty. Accordingly, not wanting to entangle his propeller\\nin this weed-choked mass, Captain Nemo stayed at a depth some meters\\nbelow the surface of the waves.\\n\\nThe name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word “sargazo,” meaning\\ngulfweed. This gulfweed, the swimming gulfweed or berry carrier, is\\nthe chief substance making up this immense shoal. And here’s why these\\nwater plants collect in this placid Atlantic basin, according to the\\nexpert on the subject, Commander Maury, author of The Physical\\nGeography of the Sea.\\n\\nThe explanation he gives seems to entail a set of conditions that\\neverybody knows: “Now,” Maury says, “if bits of cork or chaff, or any\\nfloating substance, be put into a basin, and a circular motion be\\ngiven to the water, all the light substances will be found crowding\\ntogether near the center of the pool, where there is the least\\nmotion. Just such a basin is the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf Stream,\\nand the Sargasso Sea is the center of the whirl.”\\n\\nI share Maury’s view, and I was able to study the phenomenon in this\\nexclusive setting where ships rarely go. Above us, huddled among the\\nbrown weeds, there floated objects originating from all over: tree\\ntrunks ripped from the Rocky Mountains or the Andes and sent floating\\ndown the Amazon or the Mississippi, numerous pieces of wreckage,\\nremnants of keels or undersides, bulwarks staved in and so weighed\\ndown with seashells and barnacles, they couldn’t rise to the surface\\nof the ocean. And the passing years will someday bear out Maury’s\\nother view that by collecting in this way over the centuries, these\\nsubstances will be turned to stone by the action of the waters and\\nwill then form inexhaustible coalfields. Valuable reserves prepared by\\nfarseeing nature for that time when man will have exhausted his mines\\non the continents.\\n\\nIn the midst of this hopelessly tangled fabric of weeds and fucus\\nplants, I noted some delightful pink-colored, star-shaped alcyon\\ncoral, sea anemone trailing the long tresses of their tentacles, some\\ngreen, red, and blue jellyfish, and especially those big rhizostome\\njellyfish that Cuvier described, whose bluish parasols are trimmed\\nwith violet festoons.\\n\\nWe spent the whole day of February 22 in the Sargasso Sea, where fish\\nthat dote on marine plants and crustaceans find plenty to eat. The\\nnext day the ocean resumed its usual appearance.\\n\\nFrom this moment on, for nineteen days from February 23 to March 12,\\nthe Nautilus stayed in the middle of the Atlantic, hustling us along\\nat a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty-four hours. It was\\nobvious that Captain Nemo wanted to carry out his underwater program,\\nand I had no doubt that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn, to\\nreturn to the Pacific South Seas.\\n\\nSo Ned Land had good reason to worry. In these wide seas empty of\\nislands, it was no longer feasible to jump ship. Nor did we have any\\nway to counter Captain Nemo’s whims. We had no choice but to\\nacquiesce; but if we couldn’t attain our end through force or cunning,\\nI liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion. Once this\\nvoyage was over, might not Captain Nemo consent to set us free in\\nreturn for our promise never to reveal his existence? Our word of\\nhonor, which we sincerely would have kept. However, this delicate\\nquestion would have to be negotiated with the captain. But how would\\nhe receive our demands for freedom? At the very outset and in no\\nuncertain terms, hadn’t he declared that the secret of his life\\nrequired that we be permanently imprisoned on board the Nautilus?\\nWouldn’t he see my four-month silence as a tacit acceptance of this\\nsituation? Would my returning to this subject arouse suspicions that\\ncould jeopardize our escape plans, if we had promising circumstances\\nfor trying again later on? I weighed all these considerations, turned\\nthem over in my mind, submitted them to Conseil, but he was as baffled\\nas I was. In short, although I’m not easily discouraged, I realized\\nthat my chances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by\\nthe day, especially at a time when Captain Nemo was recklessly racing\\ntoward the south Atlantic!\\n\\nDuring those nineteen days just mentioned, no unique incidents\\ndistinguished our voyage. I saw little of the captain. He was at\\nwork. In the library I often found books he had left open, especially\\nbooks on natural history. He had thumbed through my work on the great\\nocean depths, and the margins were covered with his notes, which\\nsometimes contradicted my theories and formulations. But the captain\\nremained content with this method of refining my work, and he rarely\\ndiscussed it with me. Sometimes I heard melancholy sounds\\nreverberating from the organ, which he played very expressively, but\\nonly at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness, while the\\nNautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean.\\n\\nDuring this part of our voyage, we navigated on the surface of the\\nwaves for entire days. The sea was nearly deserted. A few sailing\\nships, laden for the East Indies, were heading toward the Cape of Good\\nHope. One day we were chased by the longboats of a whaling vessel,\\nwhich undoubtedly viewed us as some enormous baleen whale of great\\nvalue. But Captain Nemo didn’t want these gallant gentlemen wasting\\ntheir time and energy, so he ended the hunt by diving beneath the\\nwaters. This incident seemed to fascinate Ned Land intensely. I’m sure\\nthe Canadian was sorry that these fishermen couldn’t harpoon our\\nsheet-iron cetacean and mortally wound it.\\n\\nDuring this period the fish Conseil and I observed differed little\\nfrom those we had already studied in other latitudes. Chief among them\\nwere specimens of that dreadful cartilaginous genus that’s divided\\ninto three subgenera numbering at least thirty-two species: striped\\nsharks five meters long, the head squat and wider than the body, the\\ncaudal fin curved, the back with seven big, black, parallel lines\\nrunning lengthwise; then perlon sharks, ash gray, pierced with seven\\ngill openings, furnished with a single dorsal fin placed almost\\nexactly in the middle of the body.\\n\\nSome big dogfish also passed by, a voracious species of shark if there\\never was one. With some justice, fishermen’s yarns aren’t to be\\ntrusted, but here’s what a few of them relate. Inside the corpse of\\none of these animals there were found a buffalo head and a whole calf;\\nin another, two tuna and a sailor in uniform; in yet another, a\\nsoldier with his saber; in another, finally, a horse with its\\nrider. In candor, none of these sounds like divinely inspired\\ntruth. But the fact remains that not a single dogfish let itself get\\ncaught in the Nautilus’s nets, so I can’t vouch for their voracity.\\n\\nSchools of elegant, playful dolphin swam alongside for entire\\ndays. They went in groups of five or six, hunting in packs like wolves\\nover the countryside; moreover, they’re just as voracious as dogfish,\\nif I can believe a certain Copenhagen professor who says that from one\\ndolphin’s stomach, he removed thirteen porpoises and fifteen\\nseals. True, it was a killer whale, belonging to the biggest known\\nspecies, whose length sometimes exceeds twenty-four feet. The family\\nDelphinia numbers ten genera, and the dolphins I saw were akin to the\\ngenus Delphinorhynchus, remarkable for an extremely narrow muzzle four\\ntimes as long as the cranium. Measuring three meters, their bodies\\nwere black on top, underneath a pinkish white strewn with small, very\\nscattered spots.\\n\\nFrom these seas I’ll also mention some unusual specimens of croakers,\\nfish from the order Acanthopterygia, family Scienidea. Some\\nauthors—more artistic than scientific—claim that these fish are\\nmelodious singers, that their voices in unison put on concerts\\nunmatched by human choristers. I don’t say nay, but to my regret these\\ncroakers didn’t serenade us as we passed.\\n\\nFinally, to conclude, Conseil classified a large number of flying\\nfish. Nothing could have made a more unusual sight than the marvelous\\ntiming with which dolphins hunt these fish. Whatever the range of its\\nflight, however evasive its trajectory (even up and over the\\nNautilus), the hapless flying fish always found a dolphin to welcome\\nit with open mouth. These were either flying gurnards or kitelike sea\\nrobins, whose lips glowed in the dark, at night scrawling fiery\\nstreaks in the air before plunging into the murky waters like so many\\nshooting stars.\\n\\nOur navigating continued under these conditions until March 13. That\\nday the Nautilus was put to work in some depth-sounding experiments\\nthat fascinated me deeply.\\n\\nBy then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point in\\nthe Pacific high seas. Our position fix placed us in latitude 45\\ndegrees 37’ south and longitude 37 degrees 53’ west. These were the\\nsame waterways where Captain Denham, aboard the Herald, payed out\\n14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom. It was here too\\nthat Lieutenant Parker, aboard the American frigate Congress, was\\nunable to reach the underwater soil at 15,149 meters.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo decided to take his Nautilus down to the lowest depths in\\norder to double-check these different soundings. I got ready to record\\nthe results of this experiment. The panels in the lounge opened, and\\nmaneuvers began for reaching those strata so prodigiously far removed.\\n\\nIt was apparently considered out of the question to dive by filling\\nthe ballast tanks. Perhaps they wouldn’t sufficiently increase the\\nNautilus’s specific gravity. Moreover, in order to come back up, it\\nwould be necessary to expel the excess water, and our pumps might not\\nhave been strong enough to overcome the outside pressure.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on an\\nappropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins, which\\nwere set at a 45 degrees angle to the Nautilus’s waterline. Then the\\npropeller was brought to its maximum speed, and its four blades\\nchurned the waves with indescribable violence.\\n\\nUnder this powerful thrust the Nautilus’s hull quivered like a\\nresonating chord, and the ship sank steadily under the\\nwaters. Stationed in the lounge, the captain and I watched the needle\\nswerving swiftly over the pressure gauge. Soon we had gone below the\\nlivable zone where most fish reside. Some of these animals can thrive\\nonly at the surface of seas or rivers, but a minority can dwell at\\nfairly great depths. Among the latter I observed a species of dogfish\\ncalled the cow shark that’s equipped with six respiratory slits, the\\ntelescope fish with its enormous eyes, the armored gurnard with gray\\nthoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by\\npale red slabs of bone, then finally the grenadier, living at a depth\\nof 1,200 meters, by that point tolerating a pressure of 120\\natmospheres.\\n\\nI asked Captain Nemo if he had observed any fish at more considerable\\ndepths.\\n\\n“Fish? Rarely!” he answered me. “But given the current state of marine\\nscience, who are we to presume, what do we really know of these\\ndepths?”\\n\\n“Just this, captain. In going toward the ocean’s lower strata, we know\\nthat vegetable life disappears more quickly than animal life. We know\\nthat moving creatures can still be encountered where water plants no\\nlonger grow. We know that oysters and pilgrim scallops live in 2,000\\nmeters of water, and that Admiral McClintock, England’s hero of the\\npolar seas, pulled in a live sea star from a depth of 2,500 meters. We\\nknow that the crew of the Royal Navy’s Bulldog fished up a starfish\\nfrom 2,620 fathoms, hence from a depth of more than one vertical\\nleague. Would you still say, Captain Nemo, that we really know\\nnothing?”\\n\\n“No, professor,” the captain replied, “I wouldn’t be so\\ndiscourteous. Yet I’ll ask you to explain how these creatures can live\\nat such depths?”\\n\\n“I explain it on two grounds,” I replied. “In the first place, because\\nvertical currents, which are caused by differences in the water’s\\nsalinity and density, can produce enough motion to sustain the\\nrudimentary lifestyles of sea lilies and starfish.”\\n\\n“True,” the captain put in.\\n\\n“In the second place, because oxygen is the basis of life, and we know\\nthat the amount of oxygen dissolved in salt water increases rather\\nthan decreases with depth, that the pressure in these lower strata\\nhelps to concentrate their oxygen content.”\\n\\n“Oho! We know that, do we?” Captain Nemo replied in a tone of mild\\nsurprise. “Well, professor, we have good reason to know it because\\nit’s the truth. I might add, in fact, that the air bladders of fish\\ncontain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals are caught at the\\nsurface of the water, and conversely, more oxygen than nitrogen when\\nthey’re pulled up from the lower depths. Which bears out your\\nformulation. But let’s continue our observations.”\\n\\nMy eyes flew back to the pressure gauge. The instrument indicated a\\ndepth of 6,000 meters. Our submergence had been going on for an\\nhour. The Nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins, still\\nsinking. These deserted waters were wonderfully clear, with a\\ntransparency impossible to convey. An hour later we were at 13,000\\nmeters—about three and a quarter vertical leagues—and the ocean floor\\nwas nowhere in sight.\\n\\nHowever, at 14,000 meters I saw blackish peaks rising in the midst of\\nthe waters. But these summits could have belonged to mountains as high\\nor even higher than the Himalayas or Mt. Blanc, and the extent of\\nthese depths remained incalculable.\\n\\nDespite the powerful pressures it was undergoing, the Nautilus sank\\nstill deeper. I could feel its sheet-iron plates trembling down to\\ntheir riveted joins; metal bars arched; bulkheads groaned; the lounge\\nwindows seemed to be warping inward under the water’s pressure. And\\nthis whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way, if, as its\\ncaptain had said, it weren’t capable of resisting like a solid block.\\n\\nWhile grazing these rocky slopes lost under the waters, I still\\nspotted some seashells, tube worms, lively annelid worms from the\\ngenus Spirorbis, and certain starfish specimens.\\n\\nBut soon these last representatives of animal life vanished, and three\\nvertical leagues down, the Nautilus passed below the limits of\\nunderwater existence just as an air balloon rises above the breathable\\nzones in the sky. We reached a depth of 16,000 meters—four vertical\\nleagues—and by then the Nautilus’s plating was tolerating a pressure\\nof 1,600 atmospheres, in other words, 1,600 kilograms per each square\\ncentimeter on its surface!\\n\\n“What an experience!” I exclaimed. “Traveling these deep regions where\\nno man has ever ventured before! Look, captain! Look at these\\nmagnificent rocks, these uninhabited caves, these last global haunts\\nwhere life is no longer possible! What unheard-of scenery, and why are\\nwe reduced to preserving it only as a memory?”\\n\\n“Would you like,” Captain Nemo asked me, “to bring back more than just\\na memory?”\\n\\n“What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I mean that nothing could be easier than taking a photograph of this\\nunderwater region!”\\n\\nBefore I had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused\\nme, a camera was carried into the lounge at Captain Nemo’s\\nrequest. The liquid setting, electrically lit, unfolded with perfect\\nclarity through the wide-open panels. No shadows, no blurs, thanks to\\nour artificial light. Not even sunshine could have been better for our\\npurposes. With the thrust of its propeller curbed by the slant of its\\nfins, the Nautilus stood still. The camera was aimed at the scenery on\\nthe ocean floor, and in a few seconds we had a perfect negative.\\n\\nI attach a print of the positive. In it you can view these primordial\\nrocks that have never seen the light of day, this nether granite that\\nforms the powerful foundation of our globe, the deep caves cut into\\nthe stony mass, the outlines of incomparable distinctness whose far\\nedges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain Flemish\\npainters. In the distance is a mountainous horizon, a wondrously\\nundulating line that makes up the background of this landscape. The\\ngeneral effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable: black,\\npolished, without moss or other blemish, carved into strange shapes,\\nsitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled beneath our streams\\nof electric light.\\n\\nMeanwhile, his photographic operations over, Captain Nemo told me:\\n\\n“Let’s go back up, professor. We mustn’t push our luck and expose the\\nNautilus too long to these pressures.”\\n\\n“Let’s go back up!” I replied.\\n\\n“Hold on tight.”\\n\\nBefore I had time to realize why the captain made this recommendation,\\nI was hurled to the carpet.\\n\\nIts fins set vertically, its propeller thrown in gear at the captain’s\\nsignal, the Nautilus rose with lightning speed, shooting upward like\\nan air balloon into the sky. Vibrating resonantly, it knifed through\\nthe watery mass. Not a single detail was visible. In four minutes it\\nhad cleared the four vertical leagues separating it from the surface\\nof the ocean, and after emerging like a flying fish, it fell back into\\nthe sea, making the waves leap to prodigious heights.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\nSperm Whales and Baleen Whales\\n\\n\\nDURING THE NIGHT of March 13-14, the Nautilus resumed its southward\\nheading. Once it was abreast of Cape Horn, I thought it would strike\\nwest of the cape, make for Pacific seas, and complete its tour of the\\nworld. It did nothing of the sort and kept moving toward the\\nsouthernmost regions. So where was it bound? The pole? That was\\ninsanity. I was beginning to think that the captain’s recklessness\\nmore than justified Ned Land’s worst fears.\\n\\nFor a good while the Canadian had said nothing more to me about his\\nescape plans. He had become less sociable, almost sullen. I could see\\nhow heavily this protracted imprisonment was weighing on him. I could\\nfeel the anger building in him. Whenever he encountered the captain,\\nhis eyes would flicker with dark fire, and I was in constant dread\\nthat his natural vehemence would cause him to do something rash.\\n\\nThat day, March 14, he and Conseil managed to find me in my\\nstateroom. I asked them the purpose of their visit.\\n\\n“To put a simple question to you, sir,” the Canadian answered me.\\n\\n“Go on, Ned.”\\n\\n“How many men do you think are on board the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“I’m unable to say, my friend.”\\n\\n“It seems to me,” Ned Land went on, “that it wouldn’t take much of a\\ncrew to run a ship like this one.”\\n\\n“Correct,” I replied. “Under existing conditions some ten men at the\\nmost should be enough to operate it.”\\n\\n“All right,” the Canadian said, “then why should there be any more\\nthan that?”\\n\\n“Why?” I answered.\\n\\nI stared at Ned Land, whose motives were easy to guess.\\n\\n“Because,” I said, “if I can trust my hunches, if I truly understand\\nthe captain’s way of life, his Nautilus isn’t simply a ship. It’s\\nmeant to be a refuge for people like its commander, people who have\\nsevered all ties with the shore.”\\n\\n“Perhaps,” Conseil said, “but in a nutshell, the Nautilus can hold\\nonly a certain number of men, so couldn’t master estimate their\\nmaximum?”\\n\\n“How, Conseil?”\\n\\n“By calculating it. Master is familiar with the ship’s capacity, hence\\nthe amount of air it contains; on the other hand, master knows how\\nmuch air each man consumes in the act of breathing, and he can compare\\nthis data with the fact that the Nautilus must rise to the surface\\nevery twenty-four hours . . .”\\n\\nConseil didn’t finish his sentence, but I could easily see what he was\\ndriving at.\\n\\n“I follow you,” I said. “But while they’re simple to do, such\\ncalculations can give only a very uncertain figure.”\\n\\n“No problem,” the Canadian went on insistently.\\n\\n“Then here’s how to calculate it,” I replied. “In one hour each man\\nconsumes the oxygen contained in 100 liters of air, hence during\\ntwenty-four hours the oxygen contained in 2,400 liters. Therefore, we\\nmust look for the multiple of 2,400 liters of air that gives us the\\namount found in the Nautilus.”\\n\\n“Precisely,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Now then,” I went on, “the Nautilus’s capacity is 1,500 metric tons,\\nand that of a ton is 1,000 liters, so the Nautilus holds 1,500,000\\nliters of air, which, divided by 2,400 . . .”\\n\\nI did a quick pencil calculation.\\n\\n“. . . gives us the quotient of 625. Which is tantamount to saying\\nthat the air contained in the Nautilus would be exactly enough for 625\\nmen over twenty-four hours.”\\n\\n“625!” Ned repeated.\\n\\n“But rest assured,” I added, “that between passengers, seamen, or\\nofficers, we don’t total one-tenth of that figure.”\\n\\n“Which is still too many for three men!” Conseil muttered.\\n\\n“So, my poor Ned, I can only counsel patience.”\\n\\n“And,” Conseil replied, “even more than patience, resignation.”\\n\\nConseil had said the true word.\\n\\n“Even so,” he went on, “Captain Nemo can’t go south forever! He’ll\\nsurely have to stop, if only at the Ice Bank, and he’ll return to the\\nseas of civilization! Then it will be time to resume Ned Land’s\\nplans.”\\n\\nThe Canadian shook his head, passed his hand over his brow, made no\\nreply, and left us.\\n\\n“With master’s permission, I’ll make an observation to him,” Conseil\\nthen told me. “Our poor Ned broods about all the things he can’t\\nhave. He’s haunted by his former life. He seems to miss everything\\nthat’s denied us. He’s obsessed by his old memories and it’s breaking\\nhis heart. We must understand him. What does he have to occupy him\\nhere? Nothing. He isn’t a scientist like master, and he doesn’t share\\nour enthusiasm for the sea’s wonders. He would risk anything just to\\nenter a tavern in his own country!”\\n\\nTo be sure, the monotony of life on board must have seemed unbearable\\nto the Canadian, who was accustomed to freedom and activity. It was a\\nrare event that could excite him. That day, however, a development\\noccurred that reminded him of his happy years as a harpooner.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the morning, while on the surface of the ocean,\\nthe Nautilus fell in with a herd of baleen whales. This encounter\\ndidn’t surprise me, because I knew these animals were being hunted so\\nrelentlessly that they took refuge in the ocean basins of the high\\nlatitudes.\\n\\nIn the maritime world and in the realm of geographic exploration,\\nwhales have played a major role. This is the animal that first dragged\\nthe Basques in its wake, then Asturian Spaniards, Englishmen, and\\nDutchmen, emboldening them against the ocean’s perils, and leading\\nthem to the ends of the earth. Baleen whales like to frequent the\\nsouthernmost and northernmost seas. Old legends even claim that these\\ncetaceans led fishermen to within a mere seven leagues of the North\\nPole. Although this feat is fictitious, it will someday come true,\\nbecause it’s likely that by hunting whales in the Arctic or Antarctic\\nregions, man will finally reach this unknown spot on the globe.\\n\\nWe were seated on the platform next to a tranquil sea. The month of\\nMarch, since it’s the equivalent of October in these latitudes, was\\ngiving us some fine autumn days. It was the Canadian—on this topic he\\nwas never mistaken—who sighted a baleen whale on the eastern\\nhorizon. If you looked carefully, you could see its blackish back\\nalternately rise and fall above the waves, five miles from the\\nNautilus.\\n\\n“Wow!” Ned Land exclaimed. “If I were on board a whaler, there’s an\\nencounter that would be great fun! That’s one big animal! Look how\\nhigh its blowholes are spouting all that air and steam! Damnation! Why\\nam I chained to this hunk of sheet iron!”\\n\\n“Why, Ned!” I replied. “You still aren’t over your old fishing urges?”\\n\\n“How could a whale fisherman forget his old trade, sir? Who could ever\\nget tired of such exciting hunting?”\\n\\n“You’ve never fished these seas, Ned?”\\n\\n“Never, sir. Just the northernmost seas, equally in the Bering Strait\\nand the Davis Strait.”\\n\\n“So the southern right whale is still unknown to you. Until now it’s\\nthe bowhead whale you’ve hunted, and it won’t risk going past the warm\\nwaters of the equator.”\\n\\n“Oh, professor, what are you feeding me?” the Canadian answered in a\\ntolerably skeptical tone.\\n\\n“I’m feeding you the facts.”\\n\\n“By thunder! In ’65, just two and a half years ago, I to whom you\\nspeak, I myself stepped onto the carcass of a whale near Greenland,\\nand its flank still carried the marked harpoon of a whaling ship from\\nthe Bering Sea. Now I ask you, after it had been wounded west of\\nAmerica, how could this animal be killed in the east, unless it had\\ncleared the equator and doubled Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope?”\\n\\n“I agree with our friend Ned,” Conseil said, “and I’m waiting to hear\\nhow master will reply to him.”\\n\\n“Master will reply, my friends, that baleen whales are localized,\\naccording to species, within certain seas that they never leave. And\\nif one of these animals went from the Bering Strait to the Davis\\nStrait, it’s quite simply because there’s some passageway from the one\\nsea to the other, either along the coasts of Canada or Siberia.”\\n\\n“You expect us to fall for that?” the Canadian asked, tipping me a\\nwink.\\n\\n“If master says so,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Which means,” the Canadian went on, “since I’ve never fished these\\nwaterways, I don’t know the whales that frequent them?”\\n\\n“That’s what I’ve been telling you, Ned.”\\n\\n“All the more reason to get to know them,” Conseil answered.\\n\\n“Look! Look!” the Canadian exclaimed, his voice full of\\nexcitement. “It’s approaching! It’s coming toward us! It’s thumbing\\nits nose at me! It knows I can’t do a blessed thing to it!”\\n\\nNed stamped his foot. Brandishing an imaginary harpoon, his hands\\npositively trembled.\\n\\n“These cetaceans,” he asked, “are they as big as the ones in the\\nnorthernmost seas?”\\n\\n“Pretty nearly, Ned.”\\n\\n“Because I’ve seen big baleen whales, sir, whales measuring up to 100\\nfeet long! I’ve even heard that those rorqual whales off the Aleutian\\nIslands sometimes get over 150 feet.”\\n\\n“That strikes me as exaggerated,” I replied. “Those animals are only\\nmembers of the genus Balaenoptera furnished with dorsal fins, and like\\nsperm whales, they’re generally smaller than the bowhead whale.”\\n\\n“Oh!” exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes hadn’t left the ocean. “It’s\\ngetting closer, it’s coming into the Nautilus’s waters!”\\n\\nThen, going on with his conversation:\\n\\n“You talk about sperm whales,” he said, “as if they were little\\nbeasts! But there are stories of gigantic sperm whales. They’re shrewd\\ncetaceans. I hear that some will cover themselves with algae and fucus\\nplants. People mistake them for islets. They pitch camp on top, make\\nthemselves at home, light a fire—”\\n\\n“Build houses,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Yes, funny man,” Ned Land replied. “Then one fine day the animal\\ndives and drags all its occupants down into the depths.”\\n\\n“Like in the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor,” I answered, laughing. “Oh,\\nMr. Land, you’re addicted to tall tales! What sperm whales you’re\\nhanding us! I hope you don’t really believe in them!”\\n\\n“Mr. Naturalist,” the Canadian replied in all seriousness, “when it\\ncomes to whales, you can believe anything! (Look at that one move!\\nLook at it stealing away!) People claim these animals can circle\\naround the world in just fifteen days.”\\n\\n“I don’t say nay.”\\n\\n“But what you undoubtedly don’t know, Professor Aronnax, is that at\\nthe beginning of the world, whales traveled even quicker.”\\n\\n“Oh really, Ned! And why so?”\\n\\n“Because in those days their tails moved side to side, like those on\\nfish, in other words, their tails were straight up, thrashing the\\nwater from left to right, right to left. But spotting that they swam\\ntoo fast, our Creator twisted their tails, and ever since they’ve been\\nthrashing the waves up and down, at the expense of their speed.”\\n\\n“Fine, Ned,” I said, then resurrected one of the Canadian’s\\nexpressions. “You expect us to fall for that?”\\n\\n“Not too terribly,” Ned Land replied, “and no more than if I told you\\nthere are whales that are 300 feet long and weigh 1,000,000 pounds.”\\n\\n“That’s indeed considerable,” I said. “But you must admit that certain\\ncetaceans do grow to significant size, since they’re said to supply as\\nmuch as 120 metric tons of oil.”\\n\\n“That I’ve seen,” the Canadian said.\\n\\n“I can easily believe it, Ned, just as I can believe that certain\\nbaleen whales equal 100 elephants in bulk. Imagine the impact of such\\na mass if it were launched at full speed!”\\n\\n“Is it true,” Conseil asked, “that they can sink ships?”\\n\\n“Ships? I doubt it,” I replied. “However, they say that in 1820, right\\nin these southern seas, a baleen whale rushed at the Essex and pushed\\nit backward at a speed of four meters per second. Its stern was\\nflooded, and the Essex went down fast.”\\n\\nNed looked at me with a bantering expression.\\n\\n“Speaking for myself,” he said, “I once got walloped by a whale’s\\ntail—in my longboat, needless to say. My companions and I were\\nlaunched to an altitude of six meters. But next to the professor’s\\nwhale, mine was just a baby.”\\n\\n“Do these animals live a long time?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“A thousand years,” the Canadian replied without hesitation.\\n\\n“And how, Ned,” I asked, “do you know that’s so?”\\n\\n“Because people say so.”\\n\\n“And why do people say so?”\\n\\n“Because people know so.”\\n\\n“No, Ned! People don’t know so, they suppose so, and here’s the logic\\nwith which they back up their beliefs. When fishermen first hunted\\nwhales 400 years ago, these animals grew to bigger sizes than they do\\ntoday. Reasonably enough, it’s assumed that today’s whales are smaller\\nbecause they haven’t had time to reach their full growth. That’s why\\nthe Count de Buffon’s encyclopedia says that cetaceans can live, and\\neven must live, for a thousand years. You understand?”\\n\\nNed Land didn’t understand. He no longer even heard me. That baleen\\nwhale kept coming closer. His eyes devoured it.\\n\\n“Oh!” he exclaimed. “It’s not just one whale, it’s ten, twenty, a\\nwhole gam! And I can’t do a thing! I’m tied hand and foot!”\\n\\n“But Ned my friend,” Conseil said, “why not ask Captain Nemo for\\npermission to hunt—”\\n\\nBefore Conseil could finish his sentence, Ned Land scooted down the\\nhatch and ran to look for the captain. A few moments later, the two of\\nthem reappeared on the platform.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo observed the herd of cetaceans cavorting on the waters a\\nmile from the Nautilus.\\n\\n“They’re southern right whales,” he said. “There goes the fortune of a\\nwhole whaling fleet.”\\n\\n“Well, sir,” the Canadian asked, “couldn’t I hunt them, just so I\\ndon’t forget my old harpooning trade?”\\n\\n“Hunt them? What for?” Captain Nemo replied. “Simply to destroy them?\\nWe have no use for whale oil on this ship.”\\n\\n“But, sir,” the Canadian went on, “in the Red Sea you authorized us to\\nchase a dugong!”\\n\\n“There it was an issue of obtaining fresh meat for my crew. Here it\\nwould be killing for the sake of killing. I’m well aware that’s a\\nprivilege reserved for mankind, but I don’t allow such murderous\\npastimes. When your peers, Mr. Land, destroy decent, harmless\\ncreatures like the southern right whale or the bowhead whale, they\\ncommit a reprehensible offense. Thus they’ve already depopulated all\\nof Baffin Bay, and they’ll wipe out a whole class of useful\\nanimals. So leave these poor cetaceans alone. They have quite enough\\nnatural enemies, such as sperm whales, swordfish, and sawfish, without\\nyou meddling with them.”\\n\\nI’ll let the reader decide what faces the Canadian made during this\\nlecture on hunting ethics. Furnishing such arguments to a professional\\nharpooner was a waste of words. Ned Land stared at Captain Nemo and\\nobviously missed his meaning. But the captain was right. Thanks to the\\nmindless, barbaric bloodthirstiness of fishermen, the last baleen\\nwhale will someday disappear from the ocean.\\n\\nNed Land whistled “Yankee Doodle” between his teeth, stuffed his hands\\nin his pockets, and turned his back on us.\\n\\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo studied the herd of cetaceans, then addressed\\nme:\\n\\n“I was right to claim that baleen whales have enough natural enemies\\nwithout counting man. These specimens will soon have to deal with\\nmighty opponents. Eight miles to leeward, Professor Aronnax, can you\\nsee those blackish specks moving about?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain,” I replied.\\n\\n“Those are sperm whales, dreadful animals that I’ve sometimes\\nencountered in herds of 200 or 300! As for them, they’re cruel,\\ndestructive beasts, and they deserve to be exterminated.”\\n\\nThe Canadian turned swiftly at these last words.\\n\\n“Well, captain,” I said, “on behalf of the baleen whales, there’s\\nstill time—”\\n\\n“It’s pointless to run any risks, professor. The Nautilus will suffice\\nto disperse these sperm whales. It’s armed with a steel spur quite\\nequal to Mr. Land’s harpoon, I imagine.”\\n\\nThe Canadian didn’t even bother shrugging his shoulders. Attacking\\ncetaceans with thrusts from a spur! Who ever heard of such malarkey!\\n\\n“Wait and see, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo said. “We’ll show you\\na style of hunting with which you aren’t yet familiar. We’ll take no\\npity on these ferocious cetaceans. They’re merely mouth and teeth!”\\n\\nMouth and teeth! There’s no better way to describe the long-skulled\\nsperm whale, whose length sometimes exceeds twenty-five meters. The\\nenormous head of this cetacean occupies about a third of its\\nbody. Better armed than a baleen whale, whose upper jaw is adorned\\nsolely with whalebone, the sperm whale is equipped with twenty-five\\nhuge teeth that are twenty centimeters high, have cylindrical, conical\\nsummits, and weigh two pounds each. In the top part of this enormous\\nhead, inside big cavities separated by cartilage, you’ll find 300 to\\n400 kilograms of that valuable oil called “spermaceti.” The sperm\\nwhale is an awkward animal, more tadpole than fish, as Professor\\nFrΘdol has noted. It’s poorly constructed, being “defective,” so to\\nspeak, over the whole left side of its frame, with good eyesight only\\nin its right eye.\\n\\nMeanwhile that monstrous herd kept coming closer. It had seen the\\nbaleen whales and was preparing to attack. You could tell in advance\\nthat the sperm whales would be victorious, not only because they were\\nbetter built for fighting than their harmless adversaries, but also\\nbecause they could stay longer underwater before returning to breathe\\nat the surface.\\n\\nThere was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales. The\\nNautilus proceeded to midwater. Conseil, Ned, and I sat in front of\\nthe lounge windows. Captain Nemo made his way to the helmsman’s side\\nto operate his submersible as an engine of destruction. Soon I felt\\nthe beats of our propeller getting faster, and we picked up speed.\\n\\nThe battle between sperm whales and baleen whales had already begun\\nwhen the Nautilus arrived. It maneuvered to cut into the herd of\\nlong-skulled predators. At first the latter showed little concern at\\nthe sight of this new monster meddling in the battle. But they soon\\nhad to sidestep its thrusts.\\n\\nWhat a struggle! Ned Land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended up\\napplauding. Brandished in its captain’s hands, the Nautilus was simply\\na fearsome harpoon. He hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran them\\nclean through, leaving behind two squirming animal halves. As for\\nthose daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides, the ship never\\nfelt them. No more than the collisions it caused. One sperm whale\\nexterminated, it ran at another, tacked on the spot so as not to miss\\nits prey, went ahead or astern, obeyed its rudder, dived when the\\ncetacean sank to deeper strata, rose with it when it returned to the\\nsurface, struck it head-on or slantwise, hacked at it or tore it, and\\nfrom every direction and at any speed, skewered it with its dreadful\\nspur.\\n\\nWhat bloodshed! What a hubbub on the surface of the waves! What sharp\\nhisses and snorts unique to these frightened animals! Their tails\\nchurned the normally peaceful strata into actual billows.\\n\\nThis Homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour, and the long-skulled\\npredators couldn’t get away. Several times ten or twelve of them\\nteamed up, trying to crush the Nautilus with their sheer mass. Through\\nthe windows you could see their enormous mouths paved with teeth,\\ntheir fearsome eyes. Losing all self-control, Ned Land hurled threats\\nand insults at them. You could feel them clinging to the submersible\\nlike hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush. But by forcing the\\npace of its propeller, the Nautilus carried them off, dragged them\\nunder, or brought them back to the upper level of the waters,\\nuntroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip.\\n\\nFinally this mass of sperm whales thinned out. The waves grew tranquil\\nagain. I felt us rising to the surface of the ocean. The hatch opened\\nand we rushed onto the platform.\\n\\nThe sea was covered with mutilated corpses. A fearsome explosion\\ncouldn’t have slashed, torn, or shredded these fleshy masses with\\ngreater violence. We were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies,\\nbluish on the back, whitish on the belly, and all deformed by enormous\\nprotuberances. A few frightened sperm whales were fleeing toward the\\nhorizon. The waves were dyed red over an area of several miles, and\\nthe Nautilus was floating in the middle of a sea of blood.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo rejoined us.\\n\\n“Well, Mr. Land?” he said.\\n\\n“Well, sir,” replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had subsided,\\n“it’s a dreadful sight for sure. But I’m a hunter not a butcher, and\\nthis is plain butchery.”\\n\\n“It was a slaughter of destructive animals,” the captain replied, “and\\nthe Nautilus is no butcher knife.”\\n\\n“I prefer my harpoon,” the Canadian answered.\\n\\n“To each his own,” the captain replied, staring intently at Ned Land.\\n\\nI was in dread the latter would give way to some violent outburst that\\nmight have had deplorable consequences. But his anger was diverted by\\nthe sight of a baleen whale that the Nautilus had pulled alongside of\\njust then.\\n\\nThis animal had been unable to escape the teeth of those sperm\\nwhales. I recognized the southern right whale, its head squat, its\\nbody dark all over. Anatomically, it’s distinguished from the white\\nwhale and the black right whale by the fusion of its seven cervical\\nvertebrae, and it numbers two more ribs than its relatives. Floating\\non its side, its belly riddled with bites, the poor cetacean was\\ndead. Still hanging from the tip of its mutilated fin was a little\\nbaby whale that it had been unable to rescue from the slaughter. Its\\nopen mouth let water flow through its whalebone like a murmuring surf.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo guided the Nautilus next to the animal’s corpse. Two of\\nhis men climbed onto the whale’s flank, and to my astonishment, I saw\\nthem draw from its udders all the milk they held, in other words,\\nenough to fill two or three casks.\\n\\nThe captain offered me a cup of this still-warm milk. I couldn’t help\\nshowing my distaste for such a beverage. He assured me that this milk\\nwas excellent, no different from cow’s milk.\\n\\nI sampled it and agreed. So this milk was a worthwhile reserve ration\\nfor us, because in the form of salt butter or cheese, it would provide\\na pleasant change of pace from our standard fare.\\n\\nFrom that day on, I noted with some uneasiness that Ned Land’s\\nattitudes toward Captain Nemo grew worse and worse, and I decided to\\nkeep a close watch on the Canadian’s movements and activities.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nThe Ice Bank\\n\\n\\nTHE NAUTILUS resumed its unruffled southbound heading. It went along\\nthe 50th meridian with considerable speed. Would it go to the pole? I\\ndidn’t think so, because every previous attempt to reach this spot on\\nthe globe had failed. Besides, the season was already quite advanced,\\nsince March 13 on Antarctic shores corresponds with September 13 in\\nthe northernmost regions, which marks the beginning of the equinoctial\\nperiod.\\n\\nOn March 14 at latitude 55 degrees, I spotted floating ice, plain pale\\nbits of rubble twenty to twenty-five feet long, which formed reefs\\nover which the sea burst into foam. The Nautilus stayed on the surface\\nof the ocean. Having fished in the Arctic seas, Ned Land was already\\nfamiliar with the sight of icebergs. Conseil and I were marveling at\\nthem for the first time.\\n\\nIn the sky toward the southern horizon, there stretched a dazzling\\nwhite band. English whalers have given this the name “ice blink.” No\\nmatter how heavy the clouds may be, they can’t obscure this\\nphenomenon. It announces the presence of a pack, or shoal, of ice.\\n\\nIndeed, larger blocks of ice soon appeared, their brilliance varying\\nat the whim of the mists. Some of these masses displayed green veins,\\nas if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate. Others looked\\nlike enormous amethysts, letting the light penetrate their\\ninsides. The latter reflected the sun’s rays from the thousand facets\\nof their crystals. The former, tinted with a bright limestone sheen,\\nwould have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble\\ntown.\\n\\nThe farther down south we went, the more these floating islands grew\\nin numbers and prominence. Polar birds nested on them by the\\nthousands. These were petrels, cape pigeons, or puffins, and their\\ncalls were deafening. Mistaking the Nautilus for the corpse of a\\nwhale, some of them alighted on it and prodded its resonant sheet iron\\nwith pecks of their beaks.\\n\\nDuring this navigating in the midst of the ice, Captain Nemo often\\nstayed on the platform. He observed these deserted waterways\\ncarefully. I saw his calm eyes sometimes perk up. In these polar seas\\nforbidden to man, did he feel right at home, the lord of these\\nunreachable regions? Perhaps. But he didn’t say. He stood still,\\nreviving only when his pilot’s instincts took over. Then, steering his\\nNautilus with consummate dexterity, he skillfully dodged the masses of\\nice, some of which measured several miles in length, their heights\\nvarying from seventy to eighty meters. Often the horizon seemed\\ncompletely closed off. Abreast of latitude 60 degrees, every\\npassageway had disappeared. Searching with care, Captain Nemo soon\\nfound a narrow opening into which he brazenly slipped, well aware,\\nhowever, that it would close behind him.\\n\\nGuided by his skillful hands, the Nautilus passed by all these\\ndifferent masses of ice, which are classified by size and shape with a\\nprecision that enraptured Conseil: “icebergs,” or mountains; “ice\\nfields,” or smooth, limitless tracts; “drift ice,” or floating floes;\\n“packs,” or broken tracts, called “patches” when they’re circular and\\n“streams” when they form long strips.\\n\\nThe temperature was fairly low. Exposed to the outside air, the\\nthermometer marked -2 degrees to\\n\\n-3 degrees centigrade. But we were warmly dressed in furs, for which\\n seals and aquatic bears had paid the price. Evenly heated by all its\\n electric equipment, the Nautilus’s interior defied the most intense\\n cold. Moreover, to find a bearable temperature, the ship had only to\\n sink just a few meters beneath the waves.\\n\\nTwo months earlier we would have enjoyed perpetual daylight in this\\nlatitude; but night already fell for three or four hours, and later it\\nwould cast six months of shadow over these circumpolar regions.\\n\\nOn March 15 we passed beyond the latitude of the South Shetland and\\nSouth Orkney Islands. The captain told me that many tribes of seals\\nused to inhabit these shores; but English and American whalers, in a\\nfrenzy of destruction, slaughtered all the adults, including pregnant\\nfemales, and where life and activity once existed, those fishermen\\nleft behind only silence and death.\\n\\nGoing along the 55th meridian, the Nautilus cut the Antarctic Circle\\non March 16 near eight o’clock in the morning. Ice completely\\nsurrounded us and closed off the horizon. Nevertheless, Captain Nemo\\nwent from passageway to passageway, always proceeding south.\\n\\n“But where’s he going?” I asked.\\n\\n“Straight ahead,” Conseil replied. “Ultimately, when he can’t go any\\nfarther, he’ll stop.”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t bet on it!” I replied.\\n\\nAnd in all honesty, I confess that this venturesome excursion was far\\nfrom displeasing to me. I can’t express the intensity of my amazement\\nat the beauties of these new regions. The ice struck superb\\nposes. Here, its general effect suggested an oriental town with\\ncountless minarets and mosques. There, a city in ruins, flung to the\\nground by convulsions in the earth. These views were varied\\ncontinuously by the sun’s oblique rays, or were completely swallowed\\nup by gray mists in the middle of blizzards. Then explosions,\\ncave-ins, and great iceberg somersaults would occur all around us,\\naltering the scenery like the changing landscape in a diorama.\\n\\nIf the Nautilus was submerged during these losses of balance, we heard\\nthe resulting noises spread under the waters with frightful intensity,\\nand the collapse of these masses created daunting eddies down to the\\nocean’s lower strata. The Nautilus then rolled and pitched like a ship\\nleft to the fury of the elements.\\n\\nOften, no longer seeing any way out, I thought we were imprisoned for\\ngood, but Captain Nemo, guided by his instincts, discovered new\\npassageways from the tiniest indications. He was never wrong when he\\nobserved slender threads of bluish water streaking through these ice\\nfields. Accordingly, I was sure that he had already risked his\\nNautilus in the midst of the Antarctic seas.\\n\\nHowever, during the day of March 16, these tracts of ice completely\\nbarred our path. It wasn’t the Ice Bank as yet, just huge ice fields\\ncemented together by the cold. This obstacle couldn’t stop Captain\\nNemo, and he launched his ship against the ice fields with hideous\\nviolence. The Nautilus went into these brittle masses like a wedge,\\nsplitting them with dreadful cracklings. It was an old-fashioned\\nbattering ram propelled with infinite power. Hurled aloft, ice rubble\\nfell back around us like hail. Through brute force alone, the\\nsubmersible carved out a channel for itself. Carried away by its\\nmomentum, the ship sometimes mounted on top of these tracts of ice and\\ncrushed them with its weight, or at other times, when cooped up\\nbeneath the ice fields, it split them with simple pitching movements,\\ncreating wide punctures.\\n\\nViolent squalls assaulted us during the daytime. Thanks to certain\\nheavy mists, we couldn’t see from one end of the platform to the\\nother. The wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass. The\\nsnow was piling up in such packed layers, it had to be chipped loose\\nwith blows from picks. Even in a temperature of merely -5 degrees\\ncentigrade, every outside part of the Nautilus was covered with ice. A\\nship’s rigging would have been unusable, because all its tackle would\\nhave jammed in the grooves of the pulleys. Only a craft without sails,\\ndriven by an electric motor that needed no coal, could face such high\\nlatitudes.\\n\\nUnder these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low. It\\nfell as far as 73.5 centimeters. Our compass indications no longer\\noffered any guarantees. The deranged needles would mark contradictory\\ndirections as we approached the southern magnetic pole, which doesn’t\\ncoincide with the South Pole proper. In fact, according to the\\nastronomer Hansteen, this magnetic pole is located fairly close to\\nlatitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees, or abiding by the\\nobservations of Louis-Isidore Duperrey, in longitude 135 degrees and\\nlatitude 70 degrees 30’. Hence we had to transport compasses to\\ndifferent parts of the ship, take many readings, and strike an\\naverage. Often we could chart our course only by guesswork, a less\\nthan satisfactory method in the midst of these winding passageways\\nwhose landmarks change continuously.\\n\\nAt last on March 18, after twenty futile assaults, the Nautilus was\\ndecisively held in check. No longer was it an ice stream, patch, or\\nfield—it was an endless, immovable barrier formed by ice mountains\\nfused to each other.\\n\\n“The Ice Bank!” the Canadian told me.\\n\\nFor Ned Land, as well as for every navigator before us, I knew that\\nthis was the great insurmountable obstacle. When the sun appeared for\\nan instant near noon, Captain Nemo took a reasonably accurate sight\\nthat gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30’ and latitude 67\\ndegrees 39’ south. This was a position already well along in these\\nAntarctic regions.\\n\\nAs for the liquid surface of the sea, there was no longer any\\nsemblance of it before our eyes. Before the Nautilus’s spur there lay\\nvast broken plains, a tangle of confused chunks with all the\\nhelter-skelter unpredictability typical of a river’s surface a short\\nwhile before its ice breakup; but in this case the proportions were\\ngigantic. Here and there stood sharp peaks, lean spires that rose as\\nhigh as 200 feet; farther off, a succession of steeply cut cliffs\\nsporting a grayish tint, huge mirrors that reflected the sparse rays\\nof a sun half drowned in mist. Beyond, a stark silence reigned in this\\ndesolate natural setting, a silence barely broken by the flapping\\nwings of petrels or puffins. By this point everything was frozen, even\\nsound.\\n\\nSo the Nautilus had to halt in its venturesome course among these\\ntracts of ice.\\n\\n“Sir,” Ned Land told me that day, “if your captain goes any farther\\n. . .”\\n\\n“Yes?”\\n\\n“He’ll be a superman.”\\n\\n“How so, Ned?”\\n\\n“Because nobody can clear the Ice Bank. Your captain’s a powerful man,\\nbut damnation, he isn’t more powerful than nature. If she draws a\\nboundary line, there you stop, like it or not!”\\n\\n“Correct, Ned Land, but I still want to know what’s behind this Ice\\nBank! Behold my greatest source of irritation—a wall!”\\n\\n“Master is right,” Conseil said. “Walls were invented simply to\\nfrustrate scientists. All walls should be banned.”\\n\\n“Fine!” the Canadian put in. “But we already know what’s behind this\\nIce Bank.”\\n\\n“What?” I asked.\\n\\n“Ice, ice, and more ice.”\\n\\n“You may be sure of that, Ned,” I answered, “but I’m not. That’s why I\\nwant to see for myself.”\\n\\n“Well, professor,” the Canadian replied, “you can just drop that idea!\\nYou’ve made it to the Ice Bank, which is already far enough, but you\\nwon’t get any farther, neither your Captain Nemo or his Nautilus. And\\nwhether he wants to or not, we’ll head north again, in other words, to\\nthe land of sensible people.”\\n\\nI had to agree that Ned Land was right, and until ships are built to\\nnavigate over tracts of ice, they’ll have to stop at the Ice Bank.\\n\\nIndeed, despite its efforts, despite the powerful methods it used to\\nsplit this ice, the Nautilus was reduced to immobility. Ordinarily,\\nwhen someone can’t go any farther, he still has the option of\\nreturning in his tracks. But here it was just as impossible to turn\\nback as to go forward, because every passageway had closed behind us,\\nand if our submersible remained even slightly stationary, it would be\\nfrozen in without delay. Which is exactly what happened near two\\no’clock in the afternoon, and fresh ice kept forming over the ship’s\\nsides with astonishing speed. I had to admit that Captain Nemo’s\\nleadership had been most injudicious.\\n\\nJust then I was on the platform. Observing the situation for some\\nwhile, the captain said to me:\\n\\n“Well, professor! What think you?”\\n\\n“I think we’re trapped, captain.”\\n\\n“Trapped! What do you mean?”\\n\\n“I mean we can’t go forward, backward, or sideways. I think that’s the\\nstandard definition of ‘trapped,’ at least in the civilized world.”\\n\\n“So, Professor Aronnax, you think the Nautilus won’t be able to float\\nclear?”\\n\\n“Only with the greatest difficulty, captain, since the season is\\nalready too advanced for you to depend on an ice breakup.”\\n\\n“Oh, professor,” Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone, “you never\\nchange! You see only impediments and obstacles! I promise you, not\\nonly will the Nautilus float clear, it will go farther still!”\\n\\n“Farther south?” I asked, gaping at the captain.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, it will go to the pole.”\\n\\n“To the pole!” I exclaimed, unable to keep back a movement of\\ndisbelief.\\n\\n“Yes,” the captain replied coolly, “the Antarctic pole, that unknown\\nspot crossed by every meridian on the globe. As you know, I do\\nwhatever I like with my Nautilus.”\\n\\nYes, I did know that! I knew this man was daring to the point of being\\nfoolhardy. But to overcome all the obstacles around the South\\nPole—even more unattainable than the North Pole, which still hadn’t\\nbeen reached by the boldest navigators—wasn’t this an absolutely\\ninsane undertaking, one that could occur only in the brain of a\\nmadman?\\n\\nIt then dawned on me to ask Captain Nemo if he had already discovered\\nthis pole, which no human being had ever trod underfoot.\\n\\n“No, sir,” he answered me, “but we’ll discover it together. Where\\nothers have failed, I’ll succeed. Never before has my Nautilus cruised\\nso far into these southernmost seas, but I repeat: it will go farther\\nstill.”\\n\\n“I’d like to believe you, captain,” I went on in a tone of some\\nsarcasm. “Oh I do believe you! Let’s forge ahead! There are no\\nobstacles for us! Let’s shatter this Ice Bank! Let’s blow it up, and\\nif it still resists, let’s put wings on the Nautilus and fly over it!”\\n\\n“Over it, professor?” Captain Nemo replied serenely. “No, not over it,\\nbut under it.”\\n\\n“Under it!” I exclaimed.\\n\\nA sudden insight into Captain Nemo’s plans had just flashed through my\\nmind. I understood. The marvelous talents of his Nautilus would be put\\nto work once again in this superhuman undertaking!\\n\\n“I can see we’re starting to understand each other, professor,”\\nCaptain Nemo told me with a half smile. “You already glimpse the\\npotential—myself, I’d say the success—of this attempt. Maneuvers that\\naren’t feasible for an ordinary ship are easy for the Nautilus. If a\\ncontinent emerges at the pole, we’ll stop at that continent. But on\\nthe other hand, if open sea washes the pole, we’ll go to that very\\nplace!”\\n\\n“Right,” I said, carried away by the captain’s logic. “Even though the\\nsurface of the sea has solidified into ice, its lower strata are still\\nopen, thanks to that divine justice that puts the maximum density of\\nsalt water one degree above its freezing point. And if I’m not\\nmistaken, the submerged part of this Ice Bank is in a four-to-one\\nratio to its emerging part.”\\n\\n“Very nearly, professor. For each foot of iceberg above the sea, there\\nare three more below. Now then, since these ice mountains don’t exceed\\na height of 100 meters, they sink only to a depth of 300 meters. And\\nwhat are 300 meters to the Nautilus?”\\n\\n“A mere nothing, sir.”\\n\\n“We could even go to greater depths and find that temperature layer\\ncommon to all ocean water, and there we’d brave with impunity the -30\\ndegrees or -40 degrees cold on the surface.”\\n\\n“True, sir, very true,” I replied with growing excitement.\\n\\n“Our sole difficulty,” Captain Nemo went on, “lies in our staying\\nsubmerged for several days without renewing our air supply.”\\n\\n“That’s all?” I answered. “The Nautilus has huge air tanks; we’ll fill\\nthem up and they’ll supply all the oxygen we need.”\\n\\n“Good thinking, Professor Aronnax,” the captain replied with a\\nsmile. “But since I don’t want to be accused of foolhardiness, I’m\\ngiving you all my objections in advance.”\\n\\n“You have more?”\\n\\n“Just one. If a sea exists at the South Pole, it’s possible this sea\\nmay be completely frozen over, so we couldn’t come up to the surface!”\\n\\n“My dear sir, have you forgotten that the Nautilus is armed with a\\nfearsome spur? Couldn’t it be launched diagonally against those tracts\\nof ice, which would break open from the impact?”\\n\\n“Ah, professor, you’re full of ideas today!”\\n\\n“Besides, captain,” I added with still greater enthusiasm, “why\\nwouldn’t we find open sea at the South Pole just as at the North Pole?\\nThe cold-temperature poles and the geographical poles don’t coincide\\nin either the northern or southern hemispheres, and until proof to the\\ncontrary, we can assume these two spots on the earth feature either a\\ncontinent or an ice-free ocean.”\\n\\n“I think as you do, Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo replied. “I’ll\\nonly point out that after raising so many objections against my plan,\\nyou’re now crushing me under arguments in its favor.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was right. I was outdoing him in daring! It was I who was\\nsweeping him to the pole. I was leading the way, I was out in front\\n. . . but no, you silly fool! Captain Nemo already knew the pros and\\ncons of this question, and it amused him to see you flying off into\\nimpossible fantasies!\\n\\nNevertheless, he didn’t waste an instant. At his signal, the chief\\nofficer appeared. The two men held a quick exchange in their\\nincomprehensible language, and either the chief officer had been\\nalerted previously or he found the plan feasible, because he showed no\\nsurprise.\\n\\nBut as unemotional as he was, he couldn’t have been more impeccably\\nemotionless than Conseil when I told the fine lad our intention of\\npushing on to the South Pole. He greeted my announcement with the\\nusual “As master wishes,” and I had to be content with that. As for\\nNed Land, no human shoulders ever executed a higher shrug than the\\npair belonging to our Canadian.\\n\\n“Honestly, sir,” he told me. “You and your Captain Nemo, I pity you\\nboth!”\\n\\n“But we will go to the pole, Mr. Land.”\\n\\n“Maybe, but you won’t come back!”\\n\\nAnd Ned Land reentered his cabin, “to keep from doing something\\ndesperate,” he said as he left me.\\n\\nMeanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under\\nway. The Nautilus’s powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks and\\nstored it under high pressure. Near four o’clock Captain Nemo informed\\nme that the platform hatches were about to be closed. I took a last\\nlook at the dense Ice Bank we were going to conquer. The weather was\\nfair, the skies reasonably clear, the cold quite brisk, namely -12\\ndegrees centigrade; but after the wind had lulled, this temperature\\ndidn’t seem too unbearable.\\n\\nEquipped with picks, some ten men climbed onto the Nautilus’s sides\\nand cracked loose the ice around the ship’s lower plating, which was\\nsoon set free. This operation was swiftly executed because the fresh\\nice was still thin. We all reentered the interior. The main ballast\\ntanks were filled with the water that hadn’t yet congealed at our line\\nof flotation. The Nautilus submerged without delay.\\n\\nI took a seat in the lounge with Conseil. Through the open window we\\nstared at the lower strata of this southernmost ocean. The thermometer\\nrose again. The needle on the pressure gauge swerved over its dial.\\n\\nAbout 300 meters down, just as Captain Nemo had predicted, we cruised\\nbeneath the undulating surface of the Ice Bank. But the Nautilus sank\\ndeeper still. It reached a depth of 800 meters. At the surface this\\nwater gave a temperature of -12 degrees centigrade, but now it gave no\\nmore than -10 degrees. Two degrees had already been gained. Thanks to\\nits heating equipment, the Nautilus’s temperature, needless to say,\\nstayed at a much higher degree. Every maneuver was accomplished with\\nextraordinary precision.\\n\\n“With all due respect to master,” Conseil told me, “we’ll pass it by.”\\n\\n“I fully expect to!” I replied in a tone of deep conviction.\\n\\nNow in open water, the Nautilus took a direct course to the pole\\nwithout veering from the 52nd meridian. From 67 degrees 30’ to 90\\ndegrees, twenty-two and a half degrees of latitude were left to cross,\\nin other words, slightly more than 500 leagues. The Nautilus adopted\\nan average speed of twenty-six miles per hour, the speed of an express\\ntrain. If it kept up this pace, forty hours would do it for reaching\\nthe pole.\\n\\nFor part of the night, the novelty of our circumstances kept Conseil\\nand me at the lounge window. The sea was lit by our beacon’s electric\\nrays. But the depths were deserted. Fish didn’t linger in these\\nimprisoned waters. Here they found merely a passageway for going from\\nthe Antarctic Ocean to open sea at the pole. Our progress was\\nswift. You could feel it in the vibrations of the long steel hull.\\n\\nNear two o’clock in the morning, I went to snatch a few hours of\\nsleep. Conseil did likewise. I didn’t encounter Captain Nemo while\\ngoing down the gangways. I assumed that he was keeping to the\\npilothouse.\\n\\nThe next day, March 19, at five o’clock in the morning, I was back at\\nmy post in the lounge. The electric log indicated that the Nautilus\\nhad reduced speed. By then it was rising to the surface, but\\ncautiously, while slowly emptying its ballast tanks.\\n\\nMy heart was pounding. Would we emerge into the open and find the\\npolar air again?\\n\\nNo. A jolt told me that the Nautilus had bumped the underbelly of the\\nIce Bank, still quite thick to judge from the hollowness of the\\naccompanying noise. Indeed, we had “struck bottom,” to use nautical\\nterminology, but in the opposite direction and at a depth of 3,000\\nfeet. That gave us 4,000 feet of ice overhead, of which 1,000 feet\\nemerged above water. So the Ice Bank was higher here than we had found\\nit on the outskirts. A circumstance less than encouraging.\\n\\nSeveral times that day, the Nautilus repeated the same experiment and\\nalways it bumped against this surface that formed a ceiling above\\nit. At certain moments the ship encountered ice at a depth of 900\\nmeters, denoting a thickness of 1,200 meters, of which 300 meters rose\\nabove the level of the ocean. This height had tripled since the moment\\nthe Nautilus had dived beneath the waves.\\n\\nI meticulously noted these different depths, obtaining the underwater\\nprofile of this upside-down mountain chain that stretched beneath the\\nsea.\\n\\nBy evening there was still no improvement in our situation. The ice\\nstayed between 400 and 500 meters deep. It was obviously shrinking,\\nbut what a barrier still lay between us and the surface of the ocean!\\n\\nBy then it was eight o’clock. The air inside the Nautilus should have\\nbeen renewed four hours earlier, following daily practice on\\nboard. But I didn’t suffer very much, although Captain Nemo hadn’t yet\\nmade demands on the supplementary oxygen in his air tanks.\\n\\nThat night my sleep was fitful. Hope and fear besieged me by turns. I\\ngot up several times. The Nautilus continued groping. Near three\\no’clock in the morning, I observed that we encountered the Ice Bank’s\\nunderbelly at a depth of only fifty meters. So only 150 feet separated\\nus from the surface of the water. Little by little the Ice Bank was\\nturning into an ice field again. The mountains were changing back into\\nplains.\\n\\nMy eyes didn’t leave the pressure gauge. We kept rising on a diagonal,\\ngoing along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric\\nrays. Above and below, the Ice Bank was subsiding in long\\ngradients. Mile after mile it was growing thinner.\\n\\nFinally, at six o’clock in the morning on that memorable day of March\\n19, the lounge door opened. Captain Nemo appeared.\\n\\n“Open sea!” he told me.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nThe South Pole\\n\\n\\nI RUSHED UP onto the platform. Yes, open sea! Barely a few sparse\\nfloes, some moving icebergs; a sea stretching into the distance; hosts\\nof birds in the air and myriads of fish under the waters, which varied\\nfrom intense blue to olive green depending on the depth. The\\nthermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade. It was as if a comparative\\nspringtime had been locked up behind that Ice Bank, whose distant\\nmasses were outlined on the northern horizon.\\n\\n“Are we at the pole?” I asked the captain, my heart pounding.\\n\\n“I’ve no idea,” he answered me. “At noon we’ll fix our position.”\\n\\n“But will the sun show through this mist?” I said, staring at the\\ngrayish sky.\\n\\n“No matter how faintly it shines, it will be enough for me,” the\\ncaptain replied.\\n\\nTo the south, ten miles from the Nautilus, a solitary islet rose to a\\nheight of 200 meters. We proceeded toward it, but cautiously, because\\nthis sea could have been strewn with reefs.\\n\\nIn an hour we had reached the islet. Two hours later we had completed\\na full circle around it. It measured four to five miles in\\ncircumference. A narrow channel separated it from a considerable\\nshore, perhaps a continent whose limits we couldn’t see. The existence\\nof this shore seemed to bear out Commander Maury’s hypotheses. In\\nessence, this ingenious American has noted that between the South Pole\\nand the 60th parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of\\ndimensions much greater than any found in the north Atlantic. From\\nthis fact he drew the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle must\\ncontain considerable shores, since icebergs can’t form on the high\\nseas but only along coastlines. According to his calculations, this\\nfrozen mass enclosing the southernmost pole forms a vast ice cap whose\\nwidth must reach 4,000 kilometers.\\n\\nMeanwhile, to avoid running aground, the Nautilus halted three cable\\nlengths from a strand crowned by superb piles of rocks. The skiff was\\nlaunched to sea. Two crewmen carrying instruments, the captain,\\nConseil, and I were on board. It was ten o’clock in the morning. I\\nhadn’t seen Ned Land. No doubt, in the presence of the South Pole, the\\nCanadian hated having to eat his words.\\n\\nA few strokes of the oar brought the skiff to the sand, where it ran\\naground. Just as Conseil was about to jump ashore, I held him back.\\n\\n“Sir,” I told Captain Nemo, “to you belongs the honor of first setting\\nfoot on this shore.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir,” the captain replied, “and if I have no hesitation in\\ntreading this polar soil, it’s because no human being until now has\\nleft a footprint here.”\\n\\nSo saying, he leaped lightly onto the sand. His heart must have been\\nthrobbing with intense excitement. He scaled an overhanging rock that\\nended in a small promontory and there, mute and motionless, with\\ncrossed arms and blazing eyes, he seemed to be laying claim to these\\nsouthernmost regions. After spending five minutes in this trance, he\\nturned to us.\\n\\n“Whenever you’re ready, sir,” he called to me.\\n\\nI got out, Conseil at my heels, leaving the two men in the skiff.\\n\\nOver an extensive area, the soil consisted of that igneous gravel\\ncalled “tuff,” reddish in color as if made from crushed bricks. The\\nground was covered with slag, lava flows, and pumice stones. Its\\nvolcanic origin was unmistakable. In certain localities thin smoke\\nholes gave off a sulfurous odor, showing that the inner fires still\\nkept their wide-ranging power. Nevertheless, when I scaled a high\\nescarpment, I could see no volcanoes within a radius of several\\nmiles. In these Antarctic districts, as is well known, Sir James Clark\\nRoss had found the craters of Mt. Erebus and Mt. Terror in fully\\nactive condition on the 167th meridian at latitude 77 degrees 32’.\\n\\nThe vegetation on this desolate continent struck me as quite\\nlimited. A few lichens of the species Usnea melanoxanthra sprawled\\nover the black rocks. The whole meager flora of this region consisted\\nof certain microscopic buds, rudimentary diatoms made up of a type of\\ncell positioned between two quartz-rich shells, plus long purple and\\ncrimson fucus plants, buoyed by small air bladders and washed up on\\nthe coast by the surf.\\n\\nThe beach was strewn with mollusks: small mussels, limpets, smooth\\nheart-shaped cockles, and especially some sea butterflies with oblong,\\nmembrane-filled bodies whose heads are formed from two rounded\\nlobes. I also saw myriads of those northernmost sea butterflies three\\ncentimeters long, which a baleen whale can swallow by the thousands in\\none gulp. The open waters at the shoreline were alive with these\\ndelightful pteropods, true butterflies of the sea.\\n\\nAmong other zoophytes present in these shallows, there were a few\\ncoral tree forms that, according to Sir James Clark Ross, live in\\nthese Antarctic seas at depths as great as 1,000 meters; then small\\nalcyon coral belonging to the species Procellaria pelagica, also a\\nlarge number of starfish unique to these climes, plus some feather\\nstars spangling the sand.\\n\\nBut it was in the air that life was superabundant. There various\\nspecies of birds flew and fluttered by the thousands, deafening us\\nwith their calls. Crowding the rocks, other fowl watched without fear\\nas we passed and pressed familiarly against our feet. These were auks,\\nas agile and supple in water, where they are sometimes mistaken for\\nfast bonito, as they are clumsy and heavy on land. They uttered\\noutlandish calls and participated in numerous public assemblies that\\nfeatured much noise but little action.\\n\\nAmong other fowl I noted some sheathbills from the wading-bird family,\\nthe size of pigeons, white in color, the beak short and conical, the\\neyes framed by red circles. Conseil laid in a supply of them, because\\nwhen they’re properly cooked, these winged creatures make a pleasant\\ndish. In the air there passed sooty albatross with four-meter\\nwingspans, birds aptly dubbed “vultures of the ocean,” also gigantic\\npetrels including several with arching wings, enthusiastic eaters of\\nseal that are known as quebrantahuesos,* and cape pigeons, a sort of\\nsmall duck, the tops of their bodies black and white—in short, a whole\\nseries of petrels, some whitish with wings trimmed in brown, others\\nblue and exclusive to these Antarctic seas, the former “so oily,” I\\ntold Conseil, “that inhabitants of the Faroe Islands simply fit the\\nbird with a wick, then light it up.”\\n\\n*Spanish: “ospreys.” Ed.\\n\\n“With that minor addition,” Conseil replied, “these fowl would make\\nperfect lamps! After this, we should insist that nature equip them\\nwith wicks in advance!”\\n\\nHalf a mile farther on, the ground was completely riddled with penguin\\nnests, egg-laying burrows from which numerous birds emerged. Later\\nCaptain Nemo had hundreds of them hunted because their black flesh is\\nhighly edible. They brayed like donkeys. The size of a goose with\\nslate-colored bodies, white undersides, and lemon-colored neck bands,\\nthese animals let themselves be stoned to death without making any\\neffort to get away.\\n\\nMeanwhile the mists didn’t clear, and by eleven o’clock the sun still\\nhadn’t made an appearance. Its absence disturbed me. Without it, no\\nsights were possible. Then how could we tell whether we had reached\\nthe pole?\\n\\nWhen I rejoined Captain Nemo, I found him leaning silently against a\\npiece of rock and staring at the sky. He seemed impatient,\\nbaffled. But what could we do? This daring and powerful man couldn’t\\ncontrol the sun as he did the sea.\\n\\nNoon arrived without the orb of day appearing for a single\\ninstant. You couldn’t even find its hiding place behind the curtain of\\nmist. And soon this mist began to condense into snow.\\n\\n“Until tomorrow,” the captain said simply; and we went back to the\\nNautilus, amid flurries in the air.\\n\\nDuring our absence the nets had been spread, and I observed with\\nfascination the fish just hauled on board. The Antarctic seas serve as\\na refuge for an extremely large number of migratory fish that flee\\nfrom storms in the subpolar zones, in truth only to slide down the\\ngullets of porpoises and seals. I noted some one-decimeter southern\\nbullhead, a species of whitish cartilaginous fish overrun with bluish\\ngray stripes and armed with stings, then some Antarctic rabbitfish\\nthree feet long, the body very slender, the skin a smooth silver\\nwhite, the head rounded, the topside furnished with three fins, the\\nsnout ending in a trunk that curved back toward the mouth. I sampled\\nits flesh but found it tasteless, despite Conseil’s views, which were\\nlargely approving.\\n\\nThe blizzard lasted until the next day. It was impossible to stay on\\nthe platform. From the lounge, where I was writing up the incidents of\\nthis excursion to the polar continent, I could hear the calls of\\npetrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil. The\\nNautilus didn’t stay idle, and cruising along the coast, it advanced\\nsome ten miles farther south amid the half light left by the sun as it\\nskimmed the edge of the horizon.\\n\\nThe next day, March 20, it stopped snowing. The cold was a little more\\nbrisk. The thermometer marked -2 degrees centigrade. The mist had\\ncleared, and on that day I hoped our noon sights could be\\naccomplished.\\n\\nSince Captain Nemo hadn’t yet appeared, only Conseil and I were taken\\nashore by the skiff. The soil’s nature was still the same:\\nvolcanic. Traces of lava, slag, and basaltic rock were everywhere, but\\nI couldn’t find the crater that had vomited them up. There as yonder,\\nmyriads of birds enlivened this part of the polar continent. But they\\nhad to share their dominion with huge herds of marine mammals that\\nlooked at us with gentle eyes. These were seals of various species,\\nsome stretched out on the ground, others lying on drifting ice floes,\\nseveral leaving or reentering the sea. Having never dealt with man,\\nthey didn’t run off at our approach, and I counted enough of them\\nthereabouts to provision a couple hundred ships.\\n\\n“Ye gods,” Conseil said, “it’s fortunate that Ned Land didn’t come\\nwith us!”\\n\\n“Why so, Conseil?”\\n\\n“Because that madcap hunter would kill every animal here.”\\n\\n“Every animal may be overstating it, but in truth I doubt we could\\nkeep our Canadian friend from harpooning some of these magnificent\\ncetaceans. Which would be an affront to Captain Nemo, since he hates\\nto slay harmless beasts needlessly.”\\n\\n“He’s right.”\\n\\n“Certainly, Conseil. But tell me, haven’t you finished classifying\\nthese superb specimens of marine fauna?”\\n\\n“Master is well aware,” Conseil replied, “that I’m not seasoned in\\npractical application. When master has told me these animals’ names\\n. . .”\\n\\n“They’re seals and walruses.”\\n\\n“Two genera,” our scholarly Conseil hastened to say, “that belong to\\nthe family Pinnipedia, order Carnivora, group Unguiculata, subclass\\nMonodelphia, class Mammalia, branch Vertebrata.”\\n\\n“Very nice, Conseil,” I replied, “but these two genera of seals and\\nwalruses are each divided into species, and if I’m not mistaken, we\\nnow have a chance to actually look at them. Let’s.”\\n\\nIt was eight o’clock in the morning. We had four hours to ourselves\\nbefore the sun could be productively observed. I guided our steps\\ntoward a huge bay that made a crescent-shaped incision in the granite\\ncliffs along the beach.\\n\\nThere, all about us, I swear that the shores and ice floes were\\ncrowded with marine mammals as far as the eye could see, and I\\ninvoluntarily looked around for old Proteus, that mythological\\nshepherd who guarded King Neptune’s immense flocks. To be specific,\\nthese were seals. They formed distinct male-and-female groups, the\\nfather watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones,\\nthe stronger youngsters emancipated a few paces away. When these\\nmammals wanted to relocate, they moved in little jumps made by\\ncontracting their bodies, clumsily helped by their imperfectly\\ndeveloped flippers, which, as with their manatee relatives, form\\nactual forearms. In the water, their ideal element, I must say these\\nanimals swim wonderfully thanks to their flexible backbones, narrow\\npelvises, close-cropped hair, and webbed feet. Resting on shore, they\\nassumed extremely graceful positions. Consequently, their gentle\\nfeatures, their sensitive expressions equal to those of the loveliest\\nwomen, their soft, limpid eyes, their charming poses, led the ancients\\nto glorify them by metamorphosing the males into sea gods and the\\nfemales into mermaids.\\n\\nI drew Conseil’s attention to the considerable growth of the cerebral\\nlobes found in these intelligent cetaceans. No mammal except man has\\nmore abundant cerebral matter. Accordingly, seals are quite capable of\\nbeing educated; they make good pets, and together with certain other\\nnaturalists, I think these animals can be properly trained to perform\\nyeoman service as hunting dogs for fishermen.\\n\\nMost of these seals were sleeping on the rocks or the sand. Among\\nthose properly termed seals—which have no external ears, unlike sea\\nlions whose ears protrude—I observed several varieties of the species\\nstenorhynchus, three meters long, with white hair, bulldog heads, and\\narmed with ten teeth in each jaw: four incisors in both the upper and\\nlower, plus two big canines shaped like the fleur-de-lis. Among them\\nslithered some sea elephants, a type of seal with a short, flexible\\ntrunk; these are the giants of the species, with a circumference of\\ntwenty feet and a length of ten meters. They didn’t move as we\\napproached.\\n\\n“Are these animals dangerous?” Conseil asked me.\\n\\n“Only if they’re attacked,” I replied. “But when these giant seals\\ndefend their little ones, their fury is dreadful, and it isn’t rare\\nfor them to smash a fisherman’s longboat to bits.”\\n\\n“They’re within their rights,” Conseil answered.\\n\\n“I don’t say nay.”\\n\\nTwo miles farther on, we were stopped by a promontory that screened\\nthe bay from southerly winds. It dropped straight down to the sea, and\\nsurf foamed against it. From beyond this ridge there came fearsome\\nbellows, such as a herd of cattle might produce.\\n\\n“Gracious,” Conseil put in, “a choir of bulls?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “a choir of walruses.”\\n\\n“Are they fighting with each other?”\\n\\n“Either fighting or playing.”\\n\\n“With all due respect to master, this we must see.”\\n\\n“Then see it we must, Conseil.”\\n\\nAnd there we were, climbing these blackish rocks amid sudden\\nlandslides and over stones slippery with ice. More than once I took a\\ntumble at the expense of my backside. Conseil, more cautious or more\\nstable, barely faltered and would help me up, saying:\\n\\n“If master’s legs would kindly adopt a wider stance, master will keep\\nhis balance.”\\n\\nArriving at the topmost ridge of this promontory, I could see vast\\nwhite plains covered with walruses. These animals were playing among\\nthemselves. They were howling not in anger but in glee.\\n\\nWalruses resemble seals in the shape of their bodies and the\\narrangement of their limbs. But their lower jaws lack canines and\\nincisors, and as for their upper canines, they consist of two tusks\\neighty centimeters long with a circumference of thirty-three\\ncentimeters at the socket. Made of solid ivory, without striations,\\nharder than elephant tusks, and less prone to yellowing, these teeth\\nare in great demand. Accordingly, walruses are the victims of a\\nmindless hunting that soon will destroy them all, since their hunters\\nindiscriminately slaughter pregnant females and youngsters, and over\\n4,000 individuals are destroyed annually.\\n\\nPassing near these unusual animals, I could examine them at my leisure\\nsince they didn’t stir. Their hides were rough and heavy, a tan color\\nleaning toward a reddish brown; their coats were short and less than\\nabundant. Some were four meters long. More tranquil and less fearful\\nthan their northern relatives, they posted no sentinels on guard duty\\nat the approaches to their campsite.\\n\\nAfter examining this community of walruses, I decided to return in my\\ntracks. It was eleven o’clock, and if Captain Nemo found conditions\\nfavorable for taking his sights, I wanted to be present at the\\noperation. But I held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance\\nthat day. It was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on\\nthe horizon. Apparently the jealous orb didn’t want to reveal this\\ninaccessible spot on the globe to any human being.\\n\\nYet I decided to return to the Nautilus. We went along a steep, narrow\\npath that ran over the cliff’s summit. By 11:30 we had arrived at our\\nlanding place. The beached skiff had brought the captain ashore. I\\nspotted him standing on a chunk of basalt. His instruments were beside\\nhim. His eyes were focused on the northern horizon, along which the\\nsun was sweeping in its extended arc.\\n\\nI found a place near him and waited without speaking. Noon arrived,\\nand just as on the day before, the sun didn’t put in an appearance.\\n\\nIt was sheer bad luck. Our noon sights were still lacking. If we\\ncouldn’t obtain them tomorrow, we would finally have to give up any\\nhope of fixing our position.\\n\\nIn essence, it was precisely March 20. Tomorrow, the 21st, was the day\\nof the equinox; the sun would disappear below the horizon for six\\nmonths not counting refraction, and after its disappearance the long\\npolar night would begin. Following the September equinox, the sun had\\nemerged above the northerly horizon, rising in long spirals until\\nDecember 21. At that time, the summer solstice of these southernmost\\ndistricts, the sun had started back down, and tomorrow it would cast\\nits last rays.\\n\\nI shared my thoughts and fears with Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“You’re right, Professor Aronnax,” he told me. “If I can’t take the\\nsun’s altitude tomorrow, I won’t be able to try again for another six\\nmonths. But precisely because sailors’ luck has led me into these seas\\non March 21, it will be easy to get our bearings if the noonday sun\\ndoes appear before our eyes.”\\n\\n“Why easy, captain?”\\n\\n“Because when the orb of day sweeps in such long spirals, it’s\\ndifficult to measure its exact altitude above the horizon, and our\\ninstruments are open to committing serious errors.”\\n\\n“Then what can you do?”\\n\\n“I use only my chronometer,” Captain Nemo answered me. “At noon\\ntomorrow, March 21, if, after accounting for refraction, the sun’s\\ndisk is cut exactly in half by the northern horizon, that will mean\\nI’m at the South Pole.”\\n\\n“Right,” I said. “Nevertheless, it isn’t mathematically exact proof,\\nbecause the equinox needn’t fall precisely at noon.”\\n\\n“No doubt, sir, but the error will be under 100 meters, and that’s\\nclose enough for us. Until tomorrow then.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo went back on board. Conseil and I stayed behind until\\nfive o’clock, surveying the beach, observing and studying. The only\\nunusual object I picked up was an auk’s egg of remarkable size, for\\nwhich a collector would have paid more than 1,000 francs. Its\\ncream-colored tint, plus the streaks and markings that decorated it\\nlike so many hieroglyphics, made it a rare trinket. I placed it in\\nConseil’s hands, and holding it like precious porcelain from China,\\nthat cautious, sure-footed lad got it back to the Nautilus in one\\npiece.\\n\\nThere I put this rare egg inside one of the glass cases in the\\nmuseum. I ate supper, feasting with appetite on an excellent piece of\\nseal liver whose flavor reminded me of pork. Then I went to bed; but\\nnot without praying, like a good Hindu, for the favors of the radiant\\norb.\\n\\nThe next day, March 21, bright and early at five o’clock in the\\nmorning, I climbed onto the platform. I found Captain Nemo there.\\n\\n“The weather is clearing a bit,” he told me. “I have high hopes. After\\nbreakfast we’ll make our way ashore and choose an observation post.”\\n\\nThis issue settled, I went to find Ned Land. I wanted to take him with\\nme. The obstinate Canadian refused, and I could clearly see that his\\ntight-lipped mood and his bad temper were growing by the day. Under\\nthe circumstances I ultimately wasn’t sorry that he refused. In truth,\\nthere were too many seals ashore, and it would never do to expose this\\nimpulsive fisherman to such temptations.\\n\\nBreakfast over, I made my way ashore. The Nautilus had gone a few more\\nmiles during the night. It lay well out, a good league from the coast,\\nwhich was crowned by a sharp peak 400 to 500 meters high. In addition\\nto me, the skiff carried Captain Nemo, two crewmen, and the\\ninstruments—in other words, a chronometer, a spyglass, and a\\nbarometer.\\n\\nDuring our crossing I saw numerous baleen whales belonging to the\\nthree species unique to these southernmost seas: the bowhead whale (or\\n“right whale,” according to the English), which has no dorsal fin; the\\nhumpback whale from the genus Balaenoptera (in other words, “winged\\nwhales”), beasts with wrinkled bellies and huge whitish fins that,\\ngenus name regardless, do not yet form wings; and the finback whale,\\nyellowish brown, the swiftest of all cetaceans. This powerful animal\\nis audible from far away when it sends up towering spouts of air and\\nsteam that resemble swirls of smoke. Herds of these different mammals\\nwere playing about in the tranquil waters, and I could easily see that\\nthis Antarctic polar basin now served as a refuge for those cetaceans\\ntoo relentlessly pursued by hunters.\\n\\nI also noted long, whitish strings of salps, a type of mollusk found\\nin clusters, and some jellyfish of large size that swayed in the\\neddies of the billows.\\n\\nBy nine o’clock we had pulled up to shore. The sky was growing\\nbrighter. Clouds were fleeing to the south. Mists were rising from the\\ncold surface of the water. Captain Nemo headed toward the peak, which\\nhe no doubt planned to make his observatory. It was an arduous climb\\nover sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst of air often reeking\\nwith sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes. For a man out of practice\\nat treading land, the captain scaled the steepest slopes with a supple\\nagility I couldn’t equal, and which would have been envied by hunters\\nof Pyrenees mountain goats.\\n\\nIt took us two hours to reach the summit of this half-crystal,\\nhalf-basalt peak. From there our eyes scanned a vast sea, which\\nscrawled its boundary line firmly against the background of the\\nnorthern sky. At our feet: dazzling tracts of white. Over our heads: a\\npale azure, clear of mists. North of us: the sun’s disk, like a ball\\nof fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon. From the heart of\\nthe waters: jets of liquid rising like hundreds of magnificent\\nbouquets. Far off, like a sleeping cetacean: the Nautilus. Behind us\\nto the south and east: an immense shore, a chaotic heap of rocks and\\nice whose limits we couldn’t see.\\n\\nArriving at the summit of this peak, Captain Nemo carefully determined\\nits elevation by means of his barometer, since he had to take this\\nfactor into account in his noon sights.\\n\\nAt 11:45 the sun, by then seen only by refraction, looked like a\\ngolden disk, dispersing its last rays over this deserted continent and\\ndown to these seas not yet plowed by the ships of man.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo had brought a spyglass with a reticular eyepiece, which\\ncorrected the sun’s refraction by means of a mirror, and he used it to\\nobserve the orb sinking little by little along a very extended\\ndiagonal that reached below the horizon. I held the chronometer. My\\nheart was pounding mightily. If the lower half of the sun’s disk\\ndisappeared just as the chronometer said noon, we were right at the\\npole.\\n\\n“Noon!” I called.\\n\\n“The South Pole!” Captain Nemo replied in a solemn voice, handing me\\nthe spyglass, which showed the orb of day cut into two exactly equal\\nparts by the horizon.\\n\\nI stared at the last rays wreathing this peak, while shadows were\\ngradually climbing its gradients.\\n\\nJust then, resting his hand on my shoulder, Captain Nemo said to me:\\n\\n“In 1600, sir, the Dutchman Gheritk was swept by storms and currents,\\nreaching latitude 64 degrees south and discovering the South Shetland\\nIslands. On January 17, 1773, the famous Captain Cook went along the\\n38th meridian, arriving at latitude 67 degrees 30’; and on January 30,\\n1774, along the 109th meridian, he reached latitude 71 degrees 15’. In\\n1819 the Russian Bellinghausen lay on the 69th parallel, and in 1821\\non the 66th at longitude 111 degrees west. In 1820 the Englishman\\nBransfield stopped at 65 degrees. That same year the American Morrel,\\nwhose reports are dubious, went along the 42nd meridian, finding open\\nsea at latitude 70 degrees 14’. In 1825 the Englishman Powell was\\nunable to get beyond 62 degrees. That same year a humble seal\\nfisherman, the Englishman Weddell, went as far as latitude 72 degrees\\n14’ on the 35th meridian, and as far as 74 degrees 15’ on the 36th. In\\n1829 the Englishman Forster, commander of the Chanticleer, laid claim\\nto the Antarctic continent in latitude 63 degrees 26’ and longitude 66\\ndegrees 26’. On February 1, 1831, the Englishman Biscoe discovered\\nEnderby Land at latitude 68 degrees 50’, Adelaide Land at latitude 67\\ndegrees on February 5, 1832, and Graham Land at latitude 64 degrees\\n45’ on February 21. In 1838 the Frenchman Dumont d’Urville stopped at\\nthe Ice Bank in latitude 62 degrees 57’, sighting the Louis-Philippe\\nPeninsula; on January 21 two years later, at a new southerly position\\nof 66 degrees 30’, he named the Adélie Coast and eight days later, the\\nClarie Coast at 64 degrees 40’. In 1838 the American Wilkes advanced\\nas far as the 69th parallel on the 100th meridian. In 1839 the\\nEnglishman Balleny discovered the Sabrina Coast at the edge of the\\npolar circle. Lastly, on January 12, 1842, with his ships, the Erebus\\nand the Terror, the Englishman Sir James Clark Ross found Victoria\\nLand in latitude 70 degrees 56’ and longitude 171 degrees 7’ east; on\\nthe 23rd of that same month, he reached the 74th parallel, a position\\ndenoting the Farthest South attained until then; on the 27th he lay at\\n76 degrees 8’; on the 28th at 77 degrees 32’; on February 2 at 78\\ndegrees 4’; and late in 1842 he returned to 71 degrees but couldn’t\\nget beyond it. Well now! In 1868, on this 21st day of March, I myself,\\nCaptain Nemo, have reached the South Pole at 90 degrees, and I hereby\\nclaim this entire part of the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known\\ncontinents.”\\n\\n“In the name of which sovereign, captain?”\\n\\n“In my own name, sir!”\\n\\nSo saying, Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag bearing a gold “N” on\\nits quartered bunting. Then, turning toward the orb of day, whose last\\nrays were licking at the sea’s horizon:\\n\\n“Farewell, O sun!” he called. “Disappear, O radiant orb! Retire\\nbeneath this open sea, and let six months of night spread their\\nshadows over my new domains!”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nAccident or Incident?\\n\\n\\nTHE NEXT DAY, March 22, at six o’clock in the morning, preparations\\nfor departure began. The last gleams of twilight were melting into\\nnight. The cold was brisk. The constellations were glittering with\\nstartling intensity. The wonderful Southern Cross, polar star of the\\nAntarctic regions, twinkled at its zenith.\\n\\nThe thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade, and a fresh breeze left\\na sharp nip in the air. Ice floes were increasing over the open\\nwater. The sea was starting to congeal everywhere. Numerous blackish\\npatches were spreading over its surface, announcing the imminent\\nformation of fresh ice. Obviously this southernmost basin froze over\\nduring its six-month winter and became utterly inaccessible. What\\nhappened to the whales during this period? No doubt they went beneath\\nthe Ice Bank to find more feasible seas. As for seals and walruses,\\nthey were accustomed to living in the harshest climates and stayed on\\nin these icy waterways. These animals know by instinct how to gouge\\nholes in the ice fields and keep them continually open; they go to\\nthese holes to breathe. Once the birds have migrated northward to\\nescape the cold, these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the\\npolar continent.\\n\\nMeanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the Nautilus sank\\nslowly. At a depth of 1,000 feet, it stopped. Its propeller churned\\nthe waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per\\nhour. Near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense\\nfrozen carapace of the Ice Bank.\\n\\nAs a precaution, the panels in the lounge stayed closed, because the\\nNautilus’s hull could run afoul of some submerged block of ice. So I\\nspent the day putting my notes into final form. My mind was completely\\nwrapped up in my memories of the pole. We had reached that\\ninaccessible spot without facing exhaustion or danger, as if our\\nseagoing passenger carriage had glided there on railroad tracks. And\\nnow we had actually started our return journey. Did it still have\\ncomparable surprises in store for me? I felt sure it did, so\\ninexhaustible is this series of underwater wonders! As it was, in the\\nfive and a half months since fate had brought us on board, we had\\ncleared 14,000 leagues, and over this track longer than the earth’s\\nequator, so many fascinating or frightening incidents had beguiled our\\nvoyage: that hunting trip in the Crespo forests, our running aground\\nin the Torres Strait, the coral cemetery, the pearl fisheries of\\nCeylon, the Arabic tunnel, the fires of Santorini, those millions in\\nthe Bay of Vigo, Atlantis, the South Pole! During the night all these\\nmemories crossed over from one dream to the next, not giving my brain\\na moment’s rest.\\n\\nAt three o’clock in the morning, I was awakened by a violent\\ncollision. I sat up in bed, listening in the darkness, and then was\\nsuddenly hurled into the middle of my stateroom. Apparently the\\nNautilus had gone aground, then heeled over sharply.\\n\\nLeaning against the walls, I dragged myself down the gangways to the\\nlounge, whose ceiling lights were on. The furniture had been knocked\\nover. Fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured at the base and\\nhad stood fast. Since we were no longer vertical, the starboard\\npictures were glued to the tapestries, while those to port had their\\nlower edges hanging a foot away from the wall. So the Nautilus was\\nlying on its starboard side, completely stationary to boot.\\n\\nIn its interior I heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices. But\\nCaptain Nemo didn’t appear. Just as I was about to leave the lounge,\\nNed Land and Conseil entered.\\n\\n“What happened?” I instantly said to them.\\n\\n“I came to ask master that,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Damnation!” the Canadian exclaimed. “I know full well what happened!\\nThe Nautilus has gone aground, and judging from the way it’s listing,\\nI don’t think it’ll pull through like that first time in the Torres\\nStrait.”\\n\\n“But,” I asked, “are we at least back on the surface of the sea?”\\n\\n“We have no idea,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“It’s easy to find out,” I answered.\\n\\nI consulted the pressure gauge. Much to my surprise, it indicated a\\ndepth of 360 meters.\\n\\n“What’s the meaning of this?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“We must confer with Captain Nemo,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“But where do we find him?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“Follow me,” I told my two companions.\\n\\nWe left the lounge. Nobody in the library. Nobody by the central\\ncompanionway or the crew’s quarters. I assumed that Captain Nemo was\\nstationed in the pilothouse. Best to wait. The three of us returned to\\nthe lounge.\\n\\nI’ll skip over the Canadian’s complaints. He had good grounds for an\\noutburst. I didn’t answer him back, letting him blow off all the steam\\nhe wanted.\\n\\nWe had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes, trying to detect the\\ntiniest noises inside the Nautilus, when Captain Nemo entered. He\\ndidn’t seem to see us. His facial features, usually so emotionless,\\nrevealed a certain uneasiness. He studied the compass and pressure\\ngauge in silence, then went and put his finger on the world map at a\\nspot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas.\\n\\nI hesitated to interrupt him. But some moments later, when he turned\\nto me, I threw back at him a phrase he had used in the Torres Strait:\\n\\n“An incident, captain?”\\n\\n“No, sir,” he replied, “this time an accident.”\\n\\n“Serious?”\\n\\n“Perhaps.”\\n\\n“Is there any immediate danger?”\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“The Nautilus has run aground?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“And this accident came about . . . ?”\\n\\n“Through nature’s unpredictability not man’s incapacity. No errors\\nwere committed in our maneuvers. Nevertheless, we can’t prevent a loss\\nof balance from taking its toll. One may defy human laws, but no one\\ncan withstand the laws of nature.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo had picked an odd time to philosophize. All in all, this\\nreply told me nothing.\\n\\n“May I learn, sir,” I asked him, “what caused this accident?”\\n\\n“An enormous block of ice, an entire mountain, has toppled over,” he\\nanswered me. “When an iceberg is eroded at the base by warmer waters\\nor by repeated collisions, its center of gravity rises. Then it\\nsomersaults, it turns completely upside down. That’s what happened\\nhere. When it overturned, one of these blocks hit the Nautilus as it\\nwas cruising under the waters. Sliding under our hull, this block then\\nraised us with irresistible power, lifting us into less congested\\nstrata where we now lie on our side.”\\n\\n“But can’t we float the Nautilus clear by emptying its ballast tanks,\\nto regain our balance?”\\n\\n“That, sir, is being done right now. You can hear the pumps\\nworking. Look at the needle on the pressure gauge. It indicates that\\nthe Nautilus is rising, but this block of ice is rising with us, and\\nuntil some obstacle halts its upward movement, our position won’t\\nchange.”\\n\\nIndeed, the Nautilus kept the same heel to starboard. No doubt it\\nwould straighten up once the block came to a halt. But before that\\nhappened, who knew if we might not hit the underbelly of the Ice Bank\\nand be hideously squeezed between two frozen surfaces?\\n\\nI mused on all the consequences of this situation. Captain Nemo didn’t\\nstop studying the pressure gauge. Since the toppling of this iceberg,\\nthe Nautilus had risen about 150 feet, but it still stayed at the same\\nangle to the perpendicular.\\n\\nSuddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull. Obviously the\\nNautilus was straightening a bit. Objects hanging in the lounge were\\nvisibly returning to their normal positions. The walls were\\napproaching the vertical. Nobody said a word. Hearts pounding, we\\ncould see and feel the ship righting itself. The floor was becoming\\nhorizontal beneath our feet. Ten minutes went by.\\n\\n“Finally, we’re upright!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes,” Captain Nemo said, heading to the lounge door.\\n\\n“But will we float off?” I asked him.\\n\\n“Certainly,” he replied, “since the ballast tanks aren’t yet empty,\\nand when they are, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea.”\\n\\nThe captain went out, and soon I saw that at his orders, the Nautilus\\nhad halted its upward movement. In fact, it soon would have hit the\\nunderbelly of the Ice Bank, but it had stopped in time and was\\nfloating in midwater.\\n\\n“That was a close call!” Conseil then said.\\n\\n“Yes. We could have been crushed between these masses of ice, or at\\nleast imprisoned between them. And then, with no way to renew our air\\nsupply. . . . Yes, that was a close call!”\\n\\n“If it’s over with!” Ned Land muttered.\\n\\nI was unwilling to get into a pointless argument with the Canadian and\\ndidn’t reply. Moreover, the panels opened just then, and the outside\\nlight burst through the uncovered windows.\\n\\nWe were fully afloat, as I have said; but on both sides of the\\nNautilus, about ten meters away, there rose dazzling walls of\\nice. There also were walls above and below. Above, because the Ice\\nBank’s underbelly spread over us like an immense ceiling. Below,\\nbecause the somersaulting block, shifting little by little, had found\\npoints of purchase on both side walls and had gotten jammed between\\nthem. The Nautilus was imprisoned in a genuine tunnel of ice about\\ntwenty meters wide and filled with quiet water. So the ship could\\neasily exit by going either ahead or astern, sinking a few hundred\\nmeters deeper, and then taking an open passageway beneath the Ice\\nBank.\\n\\nThe ceiling lights were off, yet the lounge was still brightly\\nlit. This was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice, which\\nthrew the beams of our beacon right back at us. Words cannot describe\\nthe effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge, whimsically\\nsculpted blocks, whose every angle, ridge, and facet gave off a\\ndifferent glow depending on the nature of the veins running inside the\\nice. It was a dazzling mine of gems, in particular sapphires and\\nemeralds, whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed. Here and there,\\nopaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks of light that\\nwere like so many fiery diamonds, their brilliance more than any eye\\ncould stand. The power of our beacon was increased a hundredfold, like\\na lamp shining through the biconvex lenses of a world-class\\nlighthouse.\\n\\n“How beautiful!” Conseil exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes,” I said, “it’s a wonderful sight! Isn’t it, Ned?”\\n\\n“Oh damnation, yes!” Ned Land shot back. “It’s superb! I’m furious\\nthat I have to admit it. Nobody has ever seen the like. But this sight\\ncould cost us dearly. And in all honesty, I think we’re looking at\\nthings God never intended for human eyes.”\\n\\nNed was right. It was too beautiful. All at once a yell from Conseil\\nmade me turn around.\\n\\n“What is it?” I asked.\\n\\n“Master must close his eyes! Master mustn’t look!”\\n\\nWith that, Conseil clapped his hands over his eyes.\\n\\n“But what’s wrong, my boy?”\\n\\n“I’ve been dazzled, struck blind!”\\n\\nInvoluntarily my eyes flew to the window, but I couldn’t stand the\\nfire devouring it.\\n\\nI realized what had happened. The Nautilus had just started off at\\ngreat speed. All the tranquil glimmers of the ice walls had then\\nchanged into blazing streaks. The sparkles from these myriads of\\ndiamonds were merging with each other. Swept along by its propeller,\\nthe Nautilus was traveling through a sheath of flashing light.\\n\\nThen the panels in the lounge closed. We kept our hands over our eyes,\\nwhich were utterly saturated with those concentric gleams that swirl\\nbefore the retina when sunlight strikes it too intensely. It took some\\ntime to calm our troubled vision.\\n\\nFinally we lowered our hands.\\n\\n“Ye gods, I never would have believed it,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“And I still don’t believe it!” the Canadian shot back.\\n\\n“When we return to shore, jaded from all these natural wonders,”\\nConseil added, “think how we’ll look down on those pitiful land\\nmasses, those puny works of man! No, the civilized world won’t be good\\nenough for us!”\\n\\nSuch words from the lips of this emotionless Flemish boy showed that\\nour enthusiasm was near the boiling point. But the Canadian didn’t\\nfail to throw his dram of cold water over us.\\n\\n“The civilized world!” he said, shaking his head. “Don’t worry,\\nConseil my friend, we’re never going back to that world!”\\n\\nBy this point it was five o’clock in the morning. Just then there was\\na collision in the Nautilus’s bow. I realized that its spur had just\\nbumped a block of ice. It must have been a faulty maneuver because\\nthis underwater tunnel was obstructed by such blocks and didn’t make\\nfor easy navigating. So I had assumed that Captain Nemo, in adjusting\\nhis course, would go around each obstacle or would hug the walls and\\nfollow the windings of the tunnel. In either case our forward motion\\nwouldn’t receive an absolute check. Nevertheless, contrary to my\\nexpectations, the Nautilus definitely began to move backward.\\n\\n“We’re going astern?” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied. “Apparently the tunnel has no way out at this end.”\\n\\n“And so . . . ?”\\n\\n“So,” I said, “our maneuvers are quite simple. We’ll return in our\\ntracks and go out the southern opening. That’s all.”\\n\\nAs I spoke, I tried to sound more confident than I really\\nfelt. Meanwhile the Nautilus accelerated its backward movement, and\\nrunning with propeller in reverse, it swept us along at great speed.\\n\\n“This’ll mean a delay,” Ned said.\\n\\n“What are a few hours more or less, so long as we get out.”\\n\\n“Yes,” Ned Land repeated, “so long as we get out!”\\n\\nI strolled for a little while from the lounge into the library. My\\ncompanions kept their seats and didn’t move. Soon I threw myself down\\non a couch and picked up a book, which my eyes skimmed mechanically.\\n\\nA quarter of an hour later, Conseil approached me, saying:\\n\\n“Is it deeply fascinating, this volume master is reading?”\\n\\n“Tremendously fascinating,” I replied.\\n\\n“I believe it. Master is reading his own book!”\\n\\n“My own book?”\\n\\nIndeed, my hands were holding my own work on the great ocean depths. I\\nhadn’t even suspected. I closed the book and resumed my strolling. Ned\\nand Conseil stood up to leave.\\n\\n“Stay here, my friends,” I said, stopping them. “Let’s stay together\\nuntil we’re out of this blind alley.”\\n\\n“As master wishes,” Conseil replied.\\n\\nThe hours passed. I often studied the instruments hanging on the\\nlounge wall. The pressure gauge indicated that the Nautilus stayed at\\na constant depth of 300 meters, the compass that it kept heading\\nsouth, the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty miles per\\nhour, an excessive speed in such a cramped area. But Captain Nemo knew\\nthat by this point there was no such thing as too fast, since minutes\\nwere now worth centuries.\\n\\nAt 8:25 a second collision took place. This time astern. I grew\\npale. My companions came over. I clutched Conseil’s hand. Our eyes\\nquestioned each other, and more directly than if our thoughts had been\\ntranslated into words.\\n\\nJust then the captain entered the lounge. I went to him.\\n\\n“Our path is barred to the south?” I asked him.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. When it overturned, that iceberg closed off every exit.”\\n\\n“We’re boxed in?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\nShortage of Air\\n\\n\\nCONSEQUENTLY, above, below, and around the Nautilus, there were\\nimpenetrable frozen walls. We were the Ice Bank’s prisoners! The\\nCanadian banged a table with his fearsome fist. Conseil kept still. I\\nstared at the captain. His face had resumed its usual\\nemotionlessness. He crossed his arms. He pondered. The Nautilus did\\nnot stir.\\n\\nThe captain then broke into speech:\\n\\n“Gentlemen,” he said in a calm voice, “there are two ways of dying\\nunder the conditions in which we’re placed.”\\n\\nThis inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor\\nworking out a problem for his pupils.\\n\\n“The first way,” he went on, “is death by crushing. The second is\\ndeath by asphyxiation. I don’t mention the possibility of death by\\nstarvation because the Nautilus’s provisions will certainly last\\nlonger than we will. Therefore, let’s concentrate on our chances of\\nbeing crushed or asphyxiated.”\\n\\n“As for asphyxiation, captain,” I replied, “that isn’t a cause for\\nalarm, because the air tanks are full.”\\n\\n“True,” Captain Nemo went on, “but they’ll supply air for only two\\ndays. Now then, we’ve been buried beneath the waters for thirty-six\\nhours, and the Nautilus’s heavy atmosphere already needs renewing. In\\nanother forty-eight hours, our reserve air will be used up.”\\n\\n“Well then, captain, let’s free ourselves within forty-eight hours!”\\n\\n“We’ll try to at least, by cutting through one of these walls\\nsurrounding us.”\\n\\n“Which one?” I asked.\\n\\n“Borings will tell us that. I’m going to ground the Nautilus on the\\nlower shelf, then my men will put on their diving suits and attack the\\nthinnest of these ice walls.”\\n\\n“Can the panels in the lounge be left open?”\\n\\n“Without ill effect. We’re no longer in motion.”\\n\\nCaptain Nemo went out. Hissing sounds soon told me that water was\\nbeing admitted into the ballast tanks. The Nautilus slowly settled and\\nrested on the icy bottom at a depth of 350 meters, the depth at which\\nthe lower shelf of ice lay submerged.\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “we’re in a serious predicament, but I’m\\ncounting on your courage and energy.”\\n\\n“Sir,” the Canadian replied, “this is no time to bore you with my\\ncomplaints. I’m ready to do anything I can for the common good.”\\n\\n“Excellent, Ned,” I said, extending my hand to the Canadian.\\n\\n“I might add,” he went on, “that I’m as handy with a pick as a\\nharpoon. If I can be helpful to the captain, he can use me any way he\\nwants.”\\n\\n“He won’t turn down your assistance. Come along, Ned.”\\n\\nI led the Canadian to the room where the Nautilus’s men were putting\\non their diving suits. I informed the captain of Ned’s proposition,\\nwhich was promptly accepted. The Canadian got into his underwater\\ncostume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers. Each of them\\ncarried on his back a Rouquayrol device that the air tanks had\\nsupplied with a generous allowance of fresh oxygen. A considerable but\\nnecessary drain on the Nautilus’s reserves. As for the Ruhmkorff\\nlamps, they were unnecessary in the midst of these brilliant waters\\nsaturated with our electric rays.\\n\\nAfter Ned was dressed, I reentered the lounge, whose windows had been\\nuncovered; stationed next to Conseil, I examined the strata\\nsurrounding and supporting the Nautilus.\\n\\nSome moments later, we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf of\\nice, among them Ned Land, easily recognized by his tall\\nfigure. Captain Nemo was with them.\\n\\nBefore digging into the ice, the captain had to obtain borings, to\\ninsure working in the best direction. Long bores were driven into the\\nside walls; but after fifteen meters, the instruments were still\\nimpeded by the thickness of those walls. It was futile to attack the\\nceiling since that surface was the Ice Bank itself, more than 400\\nmeters high. Captain Nemo then bored into the lower surface. There we\\nwere separated from the sea by a ten-meter barrier. That’s how thick\\nthe iceberg was. From this point on, it was an issue of cutting out a\\npiece equal in surface area to the Nautilus’s waterline. This meant\\ndetaching about 6,500 cubic meters, to dig a hole through which the\\nship could descend below this tract of ice.\\n\\nWork began immediately and was carried on with tireless\\ntenacity. Instead of digging all around the Nautilus, which would have\\nentailed even greater difficulties, Captain Nemo had an immense trench\\noutlined on the ice, eight meters from our port quarter. Then his men\\nsimultaneously staked it off at several points around its\\ncircumference. Soon their picks were vigorously attacking this compact\\nmatter, and huge chunks were loosened from its mass. These chunks\\nweighed less than the water, and by an unusual effect of specific\\ngravity, each chunk took wing, as it were, to the roof of the tunnel,\\nwhich thickened above by as much as it diminished below. But this\\nhardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner.\\n\\nAfter two hours of energetic work, Ned Land reentered, exhausted. He\\nand his companions were replaced by new workmen, including Conseil and\\nme. The Nautilus’s chief officer supervised us.\\n\\nThe water struck me as unusually cold, but I warmed up promptly while\\nwielding my pick. My movements were quite free, although they were\\nexecuted under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.\\n\\nAfter two hours of work, reentering to snatch some food and rest, I\\nfound a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid supplied\\nme by the Rouquayrol device and the Nautilus’s atmosphere, which was\\nalready charged with carbon dioxide. The air hadn’t been renewed in\\nforty-eight hours, and its life-giving qualities were considerably\\nweakened. Meanwhile, after twelve hours had gone by, we had removed\\nfrom the outlined surface area a slice of ice only one meter thick,\\nhence about 600 cubic meters. Assuming the same work would be\\naccomplished every twelve hours, it would still take five nights and\\nfour days to see the undertaking through to completion.\\n\\n“Five nights and four days!” I told my companions. “And we have oxygen\\nin the air tanks for only two days.”\\n\\n“Without taking into account,” Ned answered, “that once we’re out of\\nthis damned prison, we’ll still be cooped up beneath the Ice Bank,\\nwithout any possible contact with the open air!”\\n\\nAn apt remark. For who could predict the minimum time we would need to\\nfree ourselves? Before the Nautilus could return to the surface of the\\nwaves, couldn’t we all die of asphyxiation? Were this ship and\\neveryone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice? It was a\\ndreadful state of affairs. But we faced it head-on, each one of us\\ndetermined to do his duty to the end.\\n\\nDuring the night, in line with my forecasts, a new one-meter slice was\\nremoved from this immense socket. But in the morning, wearing my\\ndiving suit, I was crossing through the liquid mass in a temperature\\nof -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade, when I noted that little by\\nlittle the side walls were closing in on each other. The liquid strata\\nfarthest from the trench, not warmed by the movements of workmen and\\ntools, were showing a tendency to solidify. In the face of this\\nimminent new danger, what would happen to our chances for salvation,\\nand how could we prevent this liquid medium from solidifying, then\\ncracking the Nautilus’s hull like glass?\\n\\nI didn’t tell my two companions about this new danger. There was no\\npoint in dampening the energy they were putting into our arduous\\nrescue work. But when I returned on board, I mentioned this serious\\ncomplication to Captain Nemo.\\n\\n“I know,” he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook\\ncouldn’t change. “It’s one more danger, but I don’t know any way of\\nwarding it off. Our sole chance for salvation is to work faster than\\nthe water solidifies. We’ve got to get there first, that’s all.”\\n\\nGet there first! By then I should have been used to this type of talk!\\n\\nFor several hours that day, I wielded my pick doggedly. The work kept\\nme going. Besides, working meant leaving the Nautilus, which meant\\nbreathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks and supplied by\\nour equipment, which meant leaving the thin, foul air behind.\\n\\nNear evening one more meter had been dug from the trench. When I\\nreturned on board, I was wellnigh asphyxiated by the carbon dioxide\\nsaturating the air. Oh, if only we had the chemical methods that would\\nenable us to drive out this noxious gas! There was no lack of\\noxygen. All this water contained a considerable amount, and after it\\nwas decomposed by our powerful batteries, this life-giving elastic\\nfluid could have been restored to us. I had thought it all out, but to\\nno avail because the carbon dioxide produced by our breathing\\npermeated every part of the ship. To absorb it, we would need to fill\\ncontainers with potassium hydroxide and shake them continually. But\\nthis substance was missing on board and nothing else could replace it.\\n\\nThat evening Captain Nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air\\ntanks and shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the Nautilus’s\\ninterior. Without this precaution we wouldn’t have awakened the\\nfollowing morning.\\n\\nThe next day, March 26, I returned to my miner’s trade, working to\\nremove the fifth meter. The Ice Bank’s side walls and underbelly had\\nvisibly thickened. Obviously they would come together before the\\nNautilus could break free. For an instant I was gripped by despair. My\\npick nearly slipped from my hands. What was the point of this digging\\nif I was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning to stone,\\na torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages! I felt like I was\\nlying in the jaws of a fearsome monster, jaws irresistibly closing.\\n\\nSupervising our work, working himself, Captain Nemo passed near me\\njust then. I touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls of our\\nprison. The starboard wall had moved forward to a point less than four\\nmeters from the Nautilus’s hull.\\n\\nThe captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him. We returned\\non board. My diving suit removed, I went with him to the lounge.\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” he told me, “this calls for heroic measures, or\\nwe’ll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement.”\\n\\n“Yes!” I said. “But what can we do?”\\n\\n“Oh,” he exclaimed, “if only my Nautilus were strong enough to stand\\nthat much pressure without being crushed!”\\n\\n“Well?” I asked, not catching the captain’s meaning.\\n\\n“Don’t you understand,” he went on, “that the congealing of this water\\ncould come to our rescue? Don’t you see that by solidifying, it could\\nburst these tracts of ice imprisoning us, just as its freezing can\\nburst the hardest stones? Aren’t you aware that this force could be\\nthe instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction?”\\n\\n“Yes, captain, maybe so. But whatever resistance to crushing the\\nNautilus may have, it still couldn’t stand such dreadful pressures,\\nand it would be squashed as flat as a piece of sheet iron.”\\n\\n“I know it, sir. So we can’t rely on nature to rescue us, only our own\\nefforts. We must counteract this solidification. We must hold it in\\ncheck. Not only are the side walls closing in, but there aren’t ten\\nfeet of water ahead or astern of the Nautilus. All around us, this\\nfreeze is gaining fast.”\\n\\n“How long,” I asked, “will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us to\\nbreathe on board?”\\n\\nThe captain looked me straight in the eye.\\n\\n“After tomorrow,” he said, “the air tanks will be empty!”\\n\\nI broke out in a cold sweat. But why should I have been startled by\\nthis reply? On March 22 the Nautilus had dived under the open waters\\nat the pole. It was now the 26th. We had lived off the ship’s stores\\nfor five days! And all remaining breathable air had to be saved for\\nthe workmen. Even today as I write these lines, my sensations are so\\nintense that an involuntary terror sweeps over me, and my lungs still\\nseem short of air!\\n\\nMeanwhile, motionless and silent, Captain Nemo stood lost in\\nthought. An idea visibly crossed his mind. But he seemed to brush it\\naside. He told himself no. At last these words escaped his lips:\\n\\n“Boiling water!” he muttered.\\n\\n“Boiling water?” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. We’re shut up in a relatively confined area. If the\\nNautilus’s pumps continually injected streams of boiling water into\\nthis space, wouldn’t that raise its temperature and delay its\\nfreezing?”\\n\\n“It’s worth trying!” I said resolutely.\\n\\n“So let’s try it, professor.”\\n\\nBy then the thermometer gave -7 degrees centigrade outside. Captain\\nNemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling mechanism was at\\nwork, supplying drinking water via evaporation. The mechanism was\\nloaded with water, and the full electric heat of our batteries was\\nthrown into coils awash in liquid. In a few minutes the water reached\\n100 degrees centigrade. It was sent to the pumps while new water\\nreplaced it in the process. The heat generated by our batteries was so\\nintense that after simply going through the mechanism, water drawn\\ncold from the sea arrived boiling hot at the body of the pump.\\n\\nThe steaming water was injected into the icy water outside, and after\\nthree hours had passed, the thermometer gave the exterior temperature\\nas -6 degrees centigrade. That was one degree gained. Two hours later\\nthe thermometer gave only -4 degrees.\\n\\nAfter I monitored the operation’s progress, double-checking it with\\nmany inspections, I told the captain, “It’s working.”\\n\\n“I think so,” he answered me. “We’ve escaped being crushed. Now we\\nhave only asphyxiation to fear.”\\n\\nDuring the night the water temperature rose to -1 degrees\\ncentigrade. The injections couldn’t get it to go a single degree\\nhigher. But since salt water freezes only at -2 degrees, I was finally\\nassured that there was no danger of it solidifying.\\n\\nBy the next day, March 27, six meters of ice had been torn from the\\nsocket. Only four meters were left to be removed. That still meant\\nforty-eight hours of work. The air couldn’t be renewed in the\\nNautilus’s interior. Accordingly, that day it kept getting worse.\\n\\nAn unbearable heaviness weighed me down. Near three o’clock in the\\nafternoon, this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense\\ndegree. Yawns dislocated my jaws. My lungs were gasping in their quest\\nfor that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing, now growing\\nscarcer and scarcer. My mind was in a daze. I lay outstretched,\\nstrength gone, nearly unconscious. My gallant Conseil felt the same\\nsymptoms, suffered the same sufferings, yet never left my side. He\\nheld my hand, he kept encouraging me, and I even heard him mutter:\\n\\n“Oh, if only I didn’t have to breathe, to leave more air for master!”\\n\\nIt brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words.\\n\\nSince conditions inside were universally unbearable, how eagerly, how\\nhappily, we put on our diving suits to take our turns working! Picks\\nrang out on that bed of ice. Arms grew weary, hands were rubbed raw,\\nbut who cared about exhaustion, what difference were wounds?\\nLife-sustaining air reached our lungs! We could breathe! We could\\nbreathe!\\n\\nAnd yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time allotted\\nhim. His shift over, each man surrendered to a gasping companion the\\nair tank that would revive him. Captain Nemo set the example and was\\nforemost in submitting to this strict discipline. When his time was\\nup, he yielded his equipment to another and reentered the foul air on\\nboard, always calm, unflinching, and uncomplaining.\\n\\nThat day the usual work was accomplished with even greater\\nenergy. Over the whole surface area, only two meters were left to be\\nremoved. Only two meters separated us from the open sea. But the\\nship’s air tanks were nearly empty. The little air that remained had\\nto be saved for the workmen. Not an atom for the Nautilus!\\n\\nWhen I returned on board, I felt half suffocated. What a night! I’m\\nunable to depict it. Such sufferings are indescribable. The next day I\\nwas short-winded. Headaches and staggering fits of dizziness made me\\nreel like a drunk. My companions were experiencing the same\\nsymptoms. Some crewmen were at their last gasp.\\n\\nThat day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo concluded that\\npicks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still\\nseparating us from open water—and he decided to crush this layer. The\\nman had kept his energy and composure. He had subdued physical pain\\nwith moral strength. He could still think, plan, and act.\\n\\nAt his orders the craft was eased off, in other words, it was raised\\nfrom its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity. When it was\\nafloat, the crew towed it, leading it right above the immense trench\\noutlined to match the ship’s waterline. Next the ballast tanks filled\\nwith water, the boat sank, and was fitted into its socket.\\n\\nJust then the whole crew returned on board, and the double outside\\ndoor was closed. By this point the Nautilus was resting on a bed of\\nice only one meter thick and drilled by bores in a thousand places.\\n\\nThe stopcocks of the ballast tanks were then opened wide, and 100\\ncubic meters of water rushed in, increasing the Nautilus’s weight by\\n100,000 kilograms.\\n\\nWe waited, we listened, we forgot our sufferings, we hoped once\\nmore. We had staked our salvation on this one last gamble.\\n\\nDespite the buzzing in my head, I soon could hear vibrations under the\\nNautilus’s hull. We tilted. The ice cracked with an odd ripping sound,\\nlike paper tearing, and the Nautilus began settling downward.\\n\\n“We’re going through!” Conseil muttered in my ear.\\n\\nI couldn’t answer him. I clutched his hand. I squeezed it in an\\ninvoluntary convulsion.\\n\\nAll at once, carried away by its frightful excess load, the Nautilus\\nsank into the waters like a cannonball, in other words, dropping as if\\nin a vacuum!\\n\\nOur full electric power was then put on the pumps, which instantly\\nbegan to expel water from the ballast tanks. After a few minutes we\\nhad checked our fall. The pressure gauge soon indicated an ascending\\nmovement. Brought to full speed, the propeller made the sheet-iron\\nhull tremble down to its rivets, and we sped northward.\\n\\nBut how long would it take to navigate under the Ice Bank to the open\\nsea? Another day? I would be dead first!\\n\\nHalf lying on a couch in the library, I was suffocating. My face was\\npurple, my lips blue, my faculties in abeyance. I could no longer see\\nor hear. I had lost all sense of time. My muscles had no power to\\ncontract.\\n\\nI’m unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way. But I was\\naware that my death throes had begun. I realized that I was about to\\ndie . . .\\n\\nSuddenly I regained consciousness. A few whiffs of air had entered my\\nlungs. Had we risen to the surface of the waves? Had we cleared the\\nIce Bank?\\n\\nNo! Ned and Conseil, my two gallant friends, were sacrificing\\nthemselves to save me. A few atoms of air were still left in the\\ndepths of one Rouquayrol device. Instead of breathing it themselves,\\nthey had saved it for me, and while they were suffocating, they poured\\nlife into me drop by drop! I tried to push the device away. They held\\nmy hands, and for a few moments I could breathe luxuriously.\\n\\nMy eyes flew toward the clock. It was eleven in the morning. It had to\\nbe March 28. The Nautilus was traveling at the frightful speed of\\nforty miles per hour. It was writhing in the waters.\\n\\nWhere was Captain Nemo? Had he perished? Had his companions died with\\nhim?\\n\\nJust then the pressure gauge indicated we were no more than twenty\\nfeet from the surface. Separating us from the open air was a mere\\ntract of ice. Could we break through it?\\n\\nPerhaps! In any event the Nautilus was going to try. In fact, I could\\nfeel it assuming an oblique position, lowering its stern and raising\\nits spur. The admission of additional water was enough to shift its\\nbalance. Then, driven by its powerful propeller, it attacked this ice\\nfield from below like a fearsome battering ram. It split the barrier\\nlittle by little, backing up, then putting on full speed against the\\npunctured tract of ice; and finally, carried away by its supreme\\nmomentum, it lunged through and onto this frozen surface, crushing the\\nice beneath its weight.\\n\\nThe hatches were opened—or torn off, if you prefer—and waves of clean\\nair were admitted into every part of the Nautilus.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\nFrom Cape Horn to the Amazon\\n\\n\\nHOW I GOT ONTO the platform I’m unable to say. Perhaps the Canadian\\ntransferred me there. But I could breathe, I could inhale the\\nlife-giving sea air. Next to me my two companions were getting tipsy\\non the fresh oxygen particles. Poor souls who have suffered from long\\nstarvation mustn’t pounce heedlessly on the first food given them. We,\\non the other hand, didn’t have to practice such moderation: we could\\nsuck the atoms from the air by the lungful, and it was the breeze, the\\nbreeze itself, that poured into us this luxurious intoxication!\\n\\n“Ahhh!” Conseil was putting in. “What fine oxygen! Let master have no\\nfears about breathing. There’s enough for everyone.”\\n\\nAs for Ned Land, he didn’t say a word, but his wide-open jaws would\\nhave scared off a shark. And what powerful inhalations! The Canadian\\n“drew” like a furnace going full blast.\\n\\nOur strength returned promptly, and when I looked around, I saw that\\nwe were alone on the platform. No crewmen. Not even Captain\\nNemo. Those strange seamen on the Nautilus were content with the\\noxygen circulating inside. Not one of them had come up to enjoy the\\nopen air.\\n\\nThe first words I pronounced were words of appreciation and gratitude\\nto my two companions. Ned and Conseil had kept me alive during the\\nfinal hours of our long death throes. But no expression of thanks\\ncould repay them fully for such devotion.\\n\\n“Good lord, professor,” Ned Land answered me, “don’t mention it! What\\ndid we do that’s so praiseworthy? Not a thing. It was a question of\\nsimple arithmetic. Your life is worth more than ours. So we had to\\nsave it.”\\n\\n“No, Ned,” I replied, “it isn’t worth more. Nobody could be better\\nthan a kind and generous man like yourself!”\\n\\n“All right, all right!” the Canadian repeated in embarrassment.\\n\\n“And you, my gallant Conseil, you suffered a great deal.”\\n\\n“Not too much, to be candid with master. I was lacking a few\\nthroatfuls of air, but I would have gotten by. Besides, when I saw\\nmaster fainting, it left me without the slightest desire to\\nbreathe. It took my breath away, in a manner of . . .”\\n\\nConfounded by this lapse into banality, Conseil left his sentence\\nhanging.\\n\\n“My friends,” I replied, very moved, “we’re bound to each other\\nforever, and I’m deeply indebted to you—”\\n\\n“Which I’ll take advantage of,” the Canadian shot back.\\n\\n“Eh?” Conseil put in.\\n\\n“Yes,” Ned Land went on. “You can repay your debt by coming with me\\nwhen I leave this infernal Nautilus.”\\n\\n“By the way,” Conseil said, “are we going in a favorable direction?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I replied, “because we’re going in the direction of the sun,\\nand here the sun is due north.”\\n\\n“Sure,” Ned Land went on, “but it remains to be seen whether we’ll\\nmake for the Atlantic or the Pacific, in other words, whether we’ll\\nend up in well-traveled or deserted seas.”\\n\\nI had no reply to this, and I feared that Captain Nemo wouldn’t take\\nus homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores of both\\nAsia and America. In this way he would complete his underwater tour of\\nthe world, going back to those seas where the Nautilus enjoyed the\\ngreatest freedom. But if we returned to the Pacific, far from every\\npopulated shore, what would happen to Ned Land’s plans?\\n\\nWe would soon settle this important point. The Nautilus traveled\\nswiftly. Soon we had cleared the Antarctic Circle plus the promontory\\nof Cape Horn. We were abreast of the tip of South America by March 31\\nat seven o’clock in the evening.\\n\\nBy then all our past sufferings were forgotten. The memory of that\\nimprisonment under the ice faded from our minds. We had thoughts only\\nof the future. Captain Nemo no longer appeared, neither in the lounge\\nnor on the platform. The positions reported each day on the world map\\nwere put there by the chief officer, and they enabled me to determine\\nthe Nautilus’s exact heading. Now then, that evening it became\\nobvious, much to my satisfaction, that we were returning north by the\\nAtlantic route.\\n\\nI shared the results of my observations with the Canadian and Conseil.\\n\\n“That’s good news,” the Canadian replied, “but where’s the Nautilus\\ngoing?”\\n\\n“I’m unable to say, Ned.”\\n\\n“After the South Pole, does our captain want to tackle the North Pole,\\nthen go back to the Pacific by the notorious Northwest Passage?”\\n\\n“I wouldn’t double dare him,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“Oh well,” the Canadian said, “we’ll give him the slip long before\\nthen.”\\n\\n“In any event,” Conseil added, “he’s a superman, that Captain Nemo,\\nand we’ll never regret having known him.”\\n\\n“Especially once we’ve left him,” Ned Land shot back.\\n\\nThe next day, April 1, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of the\\nwaves a few minutes before noon, we raised land to the west. It was\\nTierra del Fuego, the Land of Fire, a name given it by early\\nnavigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising from the\\nnatives’ huts. This Land of Fire forms a huge cluster of islands over\\nthirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide, extending between\\nlatitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south, and between longitude 67\\ndegrees 50’ and 77 degrees 15’ west. Its coastline looked flat, but\\nhigh mountains rose in the distance. I even thought I glimpsed\\nMt. Sarmiento, whose elevation is 2,070 meters above sea level: a\\npyramid-shaped block of shale with a very sharp summit, which,\\ndepending on whether it’s clear or veiled in vapor, “predicts fair\\nweather or foul,” as Ned Land told me.\\n\\n“A first-class barometer, my friend.”\\n\\n“Yes, sir, a natural barometer that didn’t let me down when I\\nnavigated the narrows of the Strait of Magellan.”\\n\\nJust then its peak appeared before us, standing out distinctly against\\nthe background of the skies. This forecast fair weather. And so it\\nproved.\\n\\nGoing back under the waters, the Nautilus drew near the coast,\\ncruising along it for only a few miles. Through the lounge windows I\\ncould see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants, bulb-bearing\\nseaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed a few\\nspecimens; with their smooth, viscous filaments, they measured as much\\nas 300 meters long; genuine cables more than an inch thick and very\\ntough, they’re often used as mooring lines for ships. Another weed,\\nknown by the name velp and boasting four-foot leaves, was crammed into\\nthe coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor. It served as both\\nnest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans and mollusks, for\\ncrabs and cuttlefish. Here seals and otters could indulge in a\\nsumptuous meal, mixing meat from fish with vegetables from the sea,\\nlike the English with their Irish stews.\\n\\nThe Nautilus passed over these lush, luxuriant depths with tremendous\\nspeed. Near evening it approached the Falkland Islands, whose rugged\\nsummits I recognized the next day. The sea was of moderate depth. So\\nnot without good reason, I assumed that these two islands, plus the\\nmany islets surrounding them, used to be part of the Magellan\\ncoastline. The Falkland Islands were probably discovered by the famous\\nnavigator John Davis, who gave them the name Davis Southern\\nIslands. Later Sir Richard Hawkins called them the Maidenland, after\\nthe Blessed Virgin. Subsequently, at the beginning of the 18th\\ncentury, they were named the Malouines by fishermen from Saint-Malo in\\nBrittany, then finally dubbed the Falklands by the English, to whom\\nthey belong today.\\n\\nIn these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae, in\\nparticular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with the\\nworld’s best mussels. Geese and duck alighted by the dozens on the\\nplatform and soon took their places in the ship’s pantry. As for fish,\\nI specifically observed some bony fish belonging to the goby genus,\\nespecially some gudgeon two decimeters long, sprinkled with whitish\\nand yellow spots.\\n\\nI likewise marveled at the numerous medusas, including the most\\nbeautiful of their breed, the compass jellyfish, unique to the\\nFalkland seas. Some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth,\\nsemispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve neat\\nfestoons. Others looked like upside-down baskets from which wide\\nleaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing. They swam with\\nquiverings of their four leaflike arms, letting the opulent tresses of\\ntheir tentacles dangle in the drift. I wanted to preserve a few\\nspecimens of these delicate zoophytes, but they were merely clouds,\\nshadows, illusions, melting and evaporating outside their native\\nelement.\\n\\nWhen the last tips of the Falkland Islands had disappeared below the\\nhorizon, the Nautilus submerged to a depth between twenty and\\ntwenty-five meters and went along the South American coast. Captain\\nNemo didn’t put in an appearance.\\n\\nWe didn’t leave these Patagonian waterways until April 3, sometimes\\ncruising under the ocean, sometimes on its surface. The Nautilus\\npassed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the Rio de la Plata,\\nand on April 4 we lay abreast of Uruguay, albeit fifty miles\\nout. Keeping to its northerly heading, it followed the long windings\\nof South America. By then we had fared 16,000 leagues since coming on\\nboard in the seas of Japan.\\n\\nNear eleven o’clock in the morning, we cut the Tropic of Capricorn on\\nthe 37th meridian, passing well out from Cape Frio. Much to Ned Land’s\\ndispleasure, Captain Nemo had no liking for the neighborhood of\\nBrazil’s populous shores, because he shot by with dizzying speed. Not\\neven the swiftest fish or birds could keep up with us, and the natural\\ncuriosities in these seas completely eluded our observation.\\n\\nThis speed was maintained for several days, and on the evening of\\nApril 9, we raised South America’s easternmost tip, Cape São\\nRoque. But then the Nautilus veered away again and went looking for\\nthe lowest depths of an underwater valley gouged between this cape and\\nSierra Leone on the coast of Africa. Abreast of the West Indies, this\\nvalley forks into two arms, and to the north it ends in an enormous\\ndepression 9,000 meters deep. From this locality to the Lesser\\nAntilles, the ocean’s geologic profile features a steeply cut cliff\\nsix kilometers high, and abreast of the Cape Verde Islands, there’s\\nanother wall just as imposing; together these two barricades confine\\nthe whole submerged continent of Atlantis. The floor of this immense\\nvalley is made picturesque by mountains that furnish these underwater\\ndepths with scenic views. This description is based mostly on certain\\nhand-drawn charts kept in the Nautilus’s library, charts obviously\\nrendered by Captain Nemo himself from his own personal observations.\\n\\nFor two days we visited these deep and deserted waters by means of our\\nslanting fins. The Nautilus would do long, diagonal dives that took us\\nto every level. But on April 11 it rose suddenly, and the shore\\nreappeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a huge estuary whose\\noutflow is so considerable, it desalts the sea over an area of several\\nleagues.\\n\\nWe cut the Equator. Twenty miles to the west lay Guiana, French\\nterritory where we could easily have taken refuge. But the wind was\\nblowing a strong gust, and the furious billows would not allow us to\\nface them in a mere skiff. No doubt Ned Land understood this because\\nhe said nothing to me. For my part, I made no allusion to his escape\\nplans because I didn’t want to push him into an attempt that was\\ncertain to misfire.\\n\\nI was readily compensated for this delay by fascinating\\nresearch. During those two days of April 11-12, the Nautilus didn’t\\nleave the surface of the sea, and its trawl brought up a simply\\nmiraculous catch of zoophytes, fish, and reptiles.\\n\\nSome zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl. Most were\\nlovely sea anemone belonging to the family Actinidia, including among\\nother species, the Phyctalis protexta, native to this part of the\\nocean: a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines, mottled\\nwith red spots, and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles. As\\nfor mollusks, they consisted of exhibits I had already observed:\\nturret snails, olive shells of the “tent olive” species with neatly\\nintersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against a\\nflesh-colored background, fanciful spider conchs that looked like\\npetrified scorpions, transparent glass snails, argonauts, some highly\\nedible cuttlefish, and certain species of squid that the naturalists\\nof antiquity classified with the flying fish, which are used chiefly\\nas bait for catching cod.\\n\\nAs for the fish in these waterways, I noted various species that I\\nhadn’t yet had the opportunity to study. Among cartilaginous fish:\\nsome brook lamprey, a type of eel fifteen inches long, head greenish,\\nfins violet, back bluish gray, belly a silvery brown strewn with\\nbright spots, iris of the eye encircled in gold, unusual animals that\\nthe Amazon’s current must have swept out to sea because their natural\\nhabitat is fresh water; sting rays, the snout pointed, the tail long,\\nslender, and armed with an extensive jagged sting; small one-meter\\nsharks with gray and whitish hides, their teeth arranged in several\\nbackward-curving rows, fish commonly known by the name carpet shark;\\nbatfish, a sort of reddish isosceles triangle half a meter long, whose\\npectoral fins are attached by fleshy extensions that make these fish\\nlook like bats, although an appendage made of horn, located near the\\nnostrils, earns them the nickname of sea unicorns; lastly, a couple\\nspecies of triggerfish, the cucuyo whose stippled flanks glitter with\\na sparkling gold color, and the bright purple leatherjacket whose hues\\nglisten like a pigeon’s throat.\\n\\nI’ll finish up this catalog, a little dry but quite accurate, with the\\nseries of bony fish I observed: eels belonging to the genus\\nApteronotus whose snow-white snout is very blunt, the body painted a\\nhandsome black and armed with a very long, slender, fleshy whip; long\\nsardines from the genus Odontognathus, like three-decimeter pike,\\nshining with a bright silver glow; Guaranian mackerel furnished with\\ntwo anal fins; black-tinted rudderfish that you catch by using\\ntorches, fish measuring two meters and boasting white, firm, plump\\nmeat that, when fresh, tastes like eel, when dried, like smoked\\nsalmon; semired wrasse sporting scales only at the bases of their\\ndorsal and anal fins; grunts on which gold and silver mingle their\\nluster with that of ruby and topaz; yellow-tailed gilthead whose flesh\\nis extremely dainty and whose phosphorescent properties give them away\\nin the midst of the waters; porgies tinted orange, with slender\\ntongues; croakers with gold caudal fins; black surgeonfish; four-eyed\\nfish from Surinam, etc.\\n\\nThis “et cetera” won’t keep me from mentioning one more fish that\\nConseil, with good reason, will long remember.\\n\\nOne of our nets had hauled up a type of very flat ray that weighed\\nsome twenty kilograms; with its tail cut off, it would have formed a\\nperfect disk. It was white underneath and reddish on top, with big\\nround spots of deep blue encircled in black, its hide quite smooth and\\nending in a double-lobed fin. Laid out on the platform, it kept\\nstruggling with convulsive movements, trying to turn over, making such\\nefforts that its final lunge was about to flip it into the sea. But\\nConseil, being very possessive of his fish, rushed at it, and before I\\ncould stop him, he seized it with both hands.\\n\\nInstantly there he was, thrown on his back, legs in the air, his body\\nhalf paralyzed, and yelling:\\n\\n“Oh, sir, sir! Will you help me!”\\n\\nFor once in his life, the poor lad didn’t address me “in the third\\nperson.”\\n\\nThe Canadian and I sat him up; we massaged his contracted arms, and\\nwhen he regained his five senses, that eternal classifier mumbled in a\\nbroken voice:\\n\\n“Class of cartilaginous fish, order Chondropterygia with fixed gills,\\nsuborder Selacia, family Rajiiforma, genus electric ray.”\\n\\n“Yes, my friend,” I answered, “it was an electric ray that put you in\\nthis deplorable state.”\\n\\n“Oh, master can trust me on this,” Conseil shot back. “I’ll be\\nrevenged on that animal!”\\n\\n“How?”\\n\\n“I’ll eat it.”\\n\\nWhich he did that same evening, but strictly as retaliation. Because,\\nfrankly, it tasted like leather.\\n\\nPoor Conseil had assaulted an electric ray of the most dangerous\\nspecies, the cumana. Living in a conducting medium such as water, this\\nbizarre animal can electrocute other fish from several meters away, so\\ngreat is the power of its electric organ, an organ whose two chief\\nsurfaces measure at least twenty-seven square feet.\\n\\nDuring the course of the next day, April 12, the Nautilus drew near\\nthe coast of Dutch Guiana, by the mouth of the Maroni River. There\\nseveral groups of sea cows were living in family units. These were\\nmanatees, which belong to the order Sirenia, like the dugong and\\nSteller’s sea cow. Harmless and unaggressive, these fine animals were\\nsix to seven meters long and must have weighed at least 4,000\\nkilograms each. I told Ned Land and Conseil that farseeing nature had\\ngiven these mammals a major role to play. In essence, manatees, like\\nseals, are designed to graze the underwater prairies, destroying the\\nclusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers.\\n\\n“And do you know,” I added, “what happened since man has almost\\ncompletely wiped out these beneficial races? Rotting weeds have\\npoisoned the air, and this poisoned air causes the yellow fever that\\ndevastates these wonderful countries. This toxic vegetation has\\nincreased beneath the seas of the Torrid Zone, so the disease spreads\\nunchecked from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida!”\\n\\nAnd if Professor Toussenel is correct, this plague is nothing compared\\nto the scourge that will strike our descendants once the seas are\\ndepopulated of whales and seals. By then, crowded with jellyfish,\\nsquid, and other devilfish, the oceans will have become huge centers\\nof infection, because their waves will no longer possess “these huge\\nstomachs that God has entrusted with scouring the surface of the sea.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, without scorning these theories, the Nautilus’s crew\\ncaptured half a dozen manatees. In essence, it was an issue of\\nstocking the larder with excellent red meat, even better than beef or\\nveal. Their hunting was not a fascinating sport. The manatees let\\nthemselves be struck down without offering any resistance. Several\\nthousand kilos of meat were hauled below, to be dried and stored.\\n\\nThe same day an odd fishing practice further increased the Nautilus’s\\nstores, so full of game were these seas. Our trawl brought up in its\\nmeshes a number of fish whose heads were topped by little oval slabs\\nwith fleshy edges. These were suckerfish from the third family of the\\nsubbrachian Malacopterygia. These flat disks on their heads consist of\\ncrosswise plates of movable cartilage, between which the animals can\\ncreate a vacuum, enabling them to stick to objects like suction cups.\\n\\nThe remoras I had observed in the Mediterranean were related to this\\nspecies. But the creature at issue here was an Echeneis osteochara,\\nunique to this sea. Right after catching them, our seamen dropped them\\nin buckets of water.\\n\\nIts fishing finished, the Nautilus drew nearer to the coast. In this\\nlocality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface of the\\nwaves. It would have been difficult to capture these valuable\\nreptiles, because they wake up at the slightest sound, and their solid\\ncarapaces are harpoon-proof. But our suckerfish would effect their\\ncapture with extraordinary certainty and precision. In truth, this\\nanimal is a living fishhook, promising wealth and happiness to the\\ngreenest fisherman in the business.\\n\\nThe Nautilus’s men attached to each fish’s tail a ring that was big\\nenough not to hamper its movements, and to this ring a long rope whose\\nother end was moored on board.\\n\\nThrown into the sea, the suckerfish immediately began to play their\\nroles, going and fastening themselves onto the breastplates of the\\nturtles. Their tenacity was so great, they would rip apart rather than\\nlet go. They were hauled in, still sticking to the turtles that came\\naboard with them.\\n\\nIn this way we caught several loggerheads, reptiles a meter wide and\\nweighing 200 kilos. They’re extremely valuable because of their\\ncarapaces, which are covered with big slabs of horn, thin, brown,\\ntransparent, with white and yellow markings. Besides, they were\\nexcellent from an edible viewpoint, with an exquisite flavor\\ncomparable to the green turtle.\\n\\nThis fishing ended our stay in the waterways of the Amazon, and that\\nevening the Nautilus took to the high seas once more.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\nThe Devilfish\\n\\n\\nFOR SOME DAYS the Nautilus kept veering away from the American\\ncoast. It obviously didn’t want to frequent the waves of the Gulf of\\nMexico or the Caribbean Sea. Yet there was no shortage of water under\\nits keel, since the average depth of these seas is 1,800 meters; but\\nthese waterways, strewn with islands and plowed by steamers, probably\\ndidn’t agree with Captain Nemo.\\n\\nOn April 16 we raised Martinique and Guadalupe from a distance of\\nabout thirty miles. For one instant I could see their lofty peaks.\\n\\nThe Canadian was quite disheartened, having counted on putting his\\nplans into execution in the gulf, either by reaching shore or by\\npulling alongside one of the many boats plying a coastal trade from\\none island to another. An escape attempt would have been quite\\nfeasible, assuming Ned Land managed to seize the skiff without the\\ncaptain’s knowledge. But in midocean it was unthinkable.\\n\\nThe Canadian, Conseil, and I had a pretty long conversation on this\\nsubject. For six months we had been prisoners aboard the Nautilus. We\\nhad fared 17,000 leagues, and as Ned Land put it, there was no end in\\nsight. So he made me a proposition I hadn’t anticipated. We were to\\nask Captain Nemo this question straight out: did the captain mean to\\nkeep us on board his vessel permanently?\\n\\nThis measure was distasteful to me. To my mind it would lead\\nnowhere. We could hope for nothing from the Nautilus’s commander but\\ncould depend only on ourselves. Besides, for some time now the man had\\nbeen gloomier, more withdrawn, less sociable. He seemed to be avoiding\\nme. I encountered him only at rare intervals. He used to take pleasure\\nin explaining the underwater wonders to me; now he left me to my\\nresearch and no longer entered the lounge.\\n\\nWhat changes had come over him? From what cause? I had no reason to\\nblame myself. Was our presence on board perhaps a burden to him? Even\\nso, I cherished no hopes that the man would set us free.\\n\\nSo I begged Ned to let me think about it before taking action. If this\\nmeasure proved fruitless, it could arouse the captain’s suspicions,\\nmake our circumstances even more arduous, and jeopardize the\\nCanadian’s plans. I might add that I could hardly use our state of\\nhealth as an argument. Except for that grueling ordeal under the Ice\\nBank at the South Pole, we had never felt better, neither Ned,\\nConseil, nor I. The nutritious food, life-giving air, regular routine,\\nand uniform temperature kept illness at bay; and for a man who didn’t\\nmiss his past existence on land, for a Captain Nemo who was at home\\nhere, who went where he wished, who took paths mysterious to others if\\nnot himself in attaining his ends, I could understand such a life. But\\nwe ourselves hadn’t severed all ties with humanity. For my part, I\\ndidn’t want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones. I\\nhad now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea, and\\nsooner or later I wanted that book to see the light of day.\\n\\nThere once more, through the panels opening into these Caribbean\\nwaters ten meters below the surface of the waves, I found so many\\nfascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes! Among other\\nzoophytes there were Portuguese men-of-war known by the name Physalia\\npelagica, like big, oblong bladders with a pearly sheen, spreading\\ntheir membranes to the wind, letting their blue tentacles drift like\\nsilken threads; to the eye delightful jellyfish, to the touch actual\\nnettles that ooze a corrosive liquid. Among the articulates there were\\nannelid worms one and a half meters long, furnished with a pink\\nproboscis, equipped with 1,700 organs of locomotion, snaking through\\nthe waters, and as they went, throwing off every gleam in the solar\\nspectrum. From the fish branch there were manta rays, enormous\\ncartilaginous fish ten feet long and weighing 600 pounds, their\\npectoral fin triangular, their midback slightly arched, their eyes\\nattached to the edges of the face at the front of the head; they\\nfloated like wreckage from a ship, sometimes fastening onto our\\nwindows like opaque shutters. There were American triggerfish for\\nwhich nature has ground only black and white pigments, feather-shaped\\ngobies that were long and plump with yellow fins and jutting jaws,\\nsixteen-decimeter mackerel with short, sharp teeth, covered with small\\nscales, and related to the albacore species. Next came swarms of red\\nmullet corseted in gold stripes from head to tail, their shining fins\\nall aquiver, genuine masterpieces of jewelry, formerly sacred to the\\ngoddess Diana, much in demand by rich Romans, and about which the old\\nsaying goes: “He who catches them doesn’t eat them!” Finally, adorned\\nwith emerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk, golden angelfish\\npassed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of Veronese;\\nspurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins; thread\\nherring fifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent\\nglimmers; gray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails;\\nred salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals; and\\nsilver moonfish, worthy of their name, rose on the horizon of the\\nwaters like the whitish reflections of many moons.\\n\\nHow many other marvelous new specimens I still could have observed if,\\nlittle by little, the Nautilus hadn’t settled to the lower strata! Its\\nslanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters. There\\nanimal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies, starfish,\\ndelightful crinoids with bell-shaped heads like little chalices on\\nstraight stems, top-shell snails, blood-red tooth shells, and\\nfissurella snails, a large species of coastal mollusk.\\n\\nBy April 20 we had risen to an average level of 1,500 meters. The\\nnearest land was the island group of the Bahamas, scattered like a\\nbatch of cobblestones over the surface of the water. There high\\nunderwater cliffs reared up, straight walls made of craggy chunks\\narranged like big stone foundations, among which there gaped black\\ncaves so deep our electric rays couldn’t light them to the far ends.\\n\\nThese rocks were hung with huge weeds, immense sea tangle, gigantic\\nfucus—a genuine trellis of water plants fit for a world of giants.\\n\\nIn discussing these colossal plants, Conseil, Ned, and I were\\nnaturally led into mentioning the sea’s gigantic animals. The former\\nwere obviously meant to feed the latter. However, through the windows\\nof our almost motionless Nautilus, I could see nothing among these\\nlong filaments other than the chief articulates of the division\\nBrachyura: long-legged spider crabs, violet crabs, and sponge crabs\\nunique to the waters of the Caribbean.\\n\\nIt was about eleven o’clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a\\nfearsome commotion out in this huge seaweed.\\n\\n“Well,” I said, “these are real devilfish caverns, and I wouldn’t be\\nsurprised to see some of those monsters hereabouts.”\\n\\n“What!” Conseil put in. “Squid, ordinary squid from the class\\nCephalopoda?”\\n\\n“No,” I said, “devilfish of large dimensions. But friend Land is no\\ndoubt mistaken, because I don’t see a thing.”\\n\\n“That’s regrettable,” Conseil answered. “I’d like to come face to face\\nwith one of those devilfish I’ve heard so much about, which can drag\\nships down into the depths. Those beasts go by the name of krake—”\\n\\n“Fake is more like it,” the Canadian replied sarcastically.\\n\\n“Krakens!” Conseil shot back, finishing his word without wincing at\\nhis companion’s witticism.\\n\\n“Nobody will ever make me believe,” Ned Land said, “that such animals\\nexist.”\\n\\n“Why not?” Conseil replied. “We sincerely believed in master’s\\nnarwhale.”\\n\\n“We were wrong, Conseil.”\\n\\n“No doubt, but there are others with no doubts who believe to this\\nday!”\\n\\n“Probably, Conseil. But as for me, I’m bound and determined not to\\naccept the existence of any such monster till I’ve dissected it with\\nmy own two hands.”\\n\\n“Yet,” Conseil asked me, “doesn’t master believe in gigantic\\ndevilfish?”\\n\\n“Yikes! Who in Hades ever believed in them?” the Canadian exclaimed.\\n\\n“Many people, Ned my friend,” I said.\\n\\n“No fishermen. Scientists maybe!”\\n\\n“Pardon me, Ned. Fishermen and scientists!”\\n\\n“Why, I to whom you speak,” Conseil said with the world’s straightest\\nface, “I recall perfectly seeing a large boat dragged under the waves\\nby the arms of a cephalopod.”\\n\\n“You saw that?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Yes, Ned.”\\n\\n“With your own two eyes?”\\n\\n“With my own two eyes.”\\n\\n“Where, may I ask?”\\n\\n“In Saint-Malo,” Conseil returned unflappably.\\n\\n“In the harbor?” Ned Land said sarcastically.\\n\\n“No, in a church,” Conseil replied.\\n\\n“In a church!” the Canadian exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, Ned my friend. It had a picture that portrayed the devilfish in\\nquestion.”\\n\\n“Oh good!” Ned Land exclaimed with a burst of laughter. “Mr. Conseil\\nput one over on me!”\\n\\n“Actually he’s right,” I said. “I’ve heard about that picture. But the\\nsubject it portrays is taken from a legend, and you know how to rate\\nlegends in matters of natural history! Besides, when it’s an issue of\\nmonsters, the human imagination always tends to run wild. People not\\nonly claimed these devilfish could drag ships under, but a certain\\nOlaus Magnus tells of a cephalopod a mile long that looked more like\\nan island than an animal. There’s also the story of how the Bishop of\\nTrondheim set up an altar one day on an immense rock. After he\\nfinished saying mass, this rock started moving and went back into the\\nsea. The rock was a devilfish.”\\n\\n“And that’s everything we know?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“No,” I replied, “another bishop, Pontoppidan of Bergen, also tells of\\na devilfish so large a whole cavalry regiment could maneuver on it.”\\n\\n“They sure did go on, those oldtime bishops!” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“Finally, the naturalists of antiquity mention some monsters with\\nmouths as big as a gulf, which were too huge to get through the Strait\\nof Gibraltar.”\\n\\n“Good work, men!” the Canadian put in.\\n\\n“But in all these stories, is there any truth?” Conseil asked.\\n\\n“None at all, my friends, at least in those that go beyond the bounds\\nof credibility and fly off into fable or legend. Yet for the\\nimaginings of these storytellers there had to be, if not a cause, at\\nleast an excuse. It can’t be denied that some species of squid and\\nother devilfish are quite large, though still smaller than\\ncetaceans. Aristotle put the dimensions of one squid at five cubits,\\nor 3.1 meters. Our fishermen frequently see specimens over 1.8 meters\\nlong. The museums in Trieste and Montpellier have preserved some\\ndevilfish carcasses measuring two meters. Besides, according to the\\ncalculations of naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long\\nwould have tentacles as long as twenty-seven. Which is enough to make\\na fearsome monster.”\\n\\n“Does anybody fish for ‘em nowadays?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“If they don’t fish for them, sailors at least sight them. A friend of\\nmine, Captain Paul Bos of Le Havre, has often sworn to me that he\\nencountered one of these monsters of colossal size in the seas of the\\nEast Indies. But the most astonishing event, which proves that these\\ngigantic animals undeniably exist, took place a few years ago in\\n1861.”\\n\\n“What event was that?” Ned Land asked.\\n\\n“Just this. In 1861, to the northeast of Tenerife and fairly near the\\nlatitude where we are right now, the crew of the gunboat Alecto\\nspotted a monstrous squid swimming in their waters. Commander Bouguer\\napproached the animal and attacked it with blows from harpoons and\\nblasts from rifles, but without much success because bullets and\\nharpoons crossed its soft flesh as if it were semiliquid jelly. After\\nseveral fruitless attempts, the crew managed to slip a noose around\\nthe mollusk’s body. This noose slid as far as the caudal fins and came\\nto a halt. Then they tried to haul the monster on board, but its\\nweight was so considerable that when they tugged on the rope, the\\nanimal parted company with its tail; and deprived of this adornment,\\nit disappeared beneath the waters.”\\n\\n“Finally, an actual event,” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“An indisputable event, my gallant Ned. Accordingly, people have\\nproposed naming this devilfish Bouguer’s Squid.”\\n\\n“And how long was it?” the Canadian asked.\\n\\n“Didn’t it measure about six meters?” said Conseil, who was stationed\\nat the window and examining anew the crevices in the cliff.\\n\\n“Precisely,” I replied.\\n\\n“Wasn’t its head,” Conseil went on, “crowned by eight tentacles that\\nquivered in the water like a nest of snakes?”\\n\\n“Precisely.”\\n\\n“Weren’t its eyes prominently placed and considerably enlarged?”\\n\\n“Yes, Conseil.”\\n\\n“And wasn’t its mouth a real parrot’s beak but of fearsome size?”\\n\\n“Correct, Conseil.”\\n\\n“Well, with all due respect to master,” Conseil replied serenely, “if\\nthis isn’t Bouguer’s Squid, it’s at least one of his close relatives!”\\n\\nI stared at Conseil. Ned Land rushed to the window.\\n\\n“What an awful animal!” he exclaimed.\\n\\nI stared in my turn and couldn’t keep back a movement of\\nrevulsion. Before my eyes there quivered a horrible monster worthy of\\na place among the most farfetched teratological legends.\\n\\nIt was a squid of colossal dimensions, fully eight meters long. It was\\ntraveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction as the\\nNautilus. It gazed with enormous, staring eyes that were tinted sea\\ngreen. Its eight arms (or more accurately, feet) were rooted in its\\nhead, which has earned these animals the name cephalopod; its arms\\nstretched a distance twice the length of its body and were writhing\\nlike the serpentine hair of the Furies. You could plainly see its 250\\nsuckers, arranged over the inner sides of its tentacles and shaped\\nlike semispheric capsules. Sometimes these suckers fastened onto the\\nlounge window by creating vacuums against it. The monster’s mouth—a\\nbeak made of horn and shaped like that of a parrot—opened and closed\\nvertically. Its tongue, also of horn substance and armed with several\\nrows of sharp teeth, would flicker out from between these genuine\\nshears. What a freak of nature! A bird’s beak on a mollusk! Its body\\nwas spindle-shaped and swollen in the middle, a fleshy mass that must\\nhave weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms. Its unstable color would\\nchange with tremendous speed as the animal grew irritated, passing\\nsuccessively from bluish gray to reddish brown.\\n\\nWhat was irritating this mollusk? No doubt the presence of the\\nNautilus, even more fearsome than itself, and which it couldn’t grip\\nwith its mandibles or the suckers on its arms. And yet what monsters\\nthese devilfish are, what vitality our Creator has given them, what\\nvigor in their movements, thanks to their owning a triple heart!\\n\\nSheer chance had placed us in the presence of this squid, and I didn’t\\nwant to lose this opportunity to meticulously study such a cephalopod\\nspecimen. I overcame the horror that its appearance inspired in me,\\npicked up a pencil, and began to sketch it.\\n\\n“Perhaps this is the same as the Alecto’s,” Conseil said.\\n\\n“Can’t be,” the Canadian replied, “because this one’s complete while\\nthe other one lost its tail!”\\n\\n“That doesn’t necessarily follow,” I said. “The arms and tails of\\nthese animals grow back through regeneration, and in seven years the\\ntail on Bouguer’s Squid has surely had time to sprout again.”\\n\\n“Anyhow,” Ned shot back, “if it isn’t this fellow, maybe it’s one of\\nthose!”\\n\\nIndeed, other devilfish had appeared at the starboard window. I\\ncounted seven of them. They provided the Nautilus with an escort, and\\nI could hear their beaks gnashing on the sheet-iron hull. We couldn’t\\nhave asked for a more devoted following.\\n\\nI continued sketching. These monsters kept pace in our waters with\\nsuch precision, they seemed to be standing still, and I could have\\ntraced their outlines in miniature on the window. But we were moving\\nat a moderate speed.\\n\\nAll at once the Nautilus stopped. A jolt made it tremble through its\\nentire framework.\\n\\n“Did we strike bottom?” I asked.\\n\\n“In any event we’re already clear,” the Canadian replied, “because\\nwe’re afloat.”\\n\\nThe Nautilus was certainly afloat, but it was no longer in motion. The\\nblades of its propeller weren’t churning the waves. A minute\\npassed. Followed by his chief officer, Captain Nemo entered the\\nlounge.\\n\\nI hadn’t seen him for a good while. He looked gloomy to me. Without\\nspeaking to us, without even seeing us perhaps, he went to the panel,\\nstared at the devilfish, and said a few words to his chief officer.\\n\\nThe latter went out. Soon the panels closed. The ceiling lit up.\\n\\nI went over to the captain.\\n\\n“An unusual assortment of devilfish,” I told him, as carefree as a\\ncollector in front of an aquarium.\\n\\n“Correct, Mr. Naturalist,” he answered me, “and we’re going to fight\\nthem at close quarters.”\\n\\nI gaped at the captain. I thought my hearing had gone bad.\\n\\n“At close quarters?” I repeated.\\n\\n“Yes, sir. Our propeller is jammed. I think the horn-covered mandibles\\nof one of these squid are entangled in the blades. That’s why we\\naren’t moving.”\\n\\n“And what are you going to do?”\\n\\n“Rise to the surface and slaughter the vermin.”\\n\\n“A difficult undertaking.”\\n\\n“Correct. Our electric bullets are ineffective against such soft\\nflesh, where they don’t meet enough resistance to go off. But we’ll\\nattack the beasts with axes.”\\n\\n“And harpoons, sir,” the Canadian said, “if you don’t turn down my\\nhelp.”\\n\\n“I accept it, Mr. Land.”\\n\\n“We’ll go with you,” I said. And we followed Captain Nemo, heading to\\nthe central companionway.\\n\\nThere some ten men were standing by for the assault, armed with\\nboarding axes. Conseil and I picked up two more axes. Ned Land seized\\na harpoon.\\n\\nBy then the Nautilus had returned to the surface of the\\nwaves. Stationed on the top steps, one of the seamen undid the bolts\\nof the hatch. But he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch\\nflew up with tremendous violence, obviously pulled open by the suckers\\non a devilfish’s arm.\\n\\nInstantly one of those long arms glided like a snake into the opening,\\nand twenty others were quivering above. With a sweep of the ax,\\nCaptain Nemo chopped off this fearsome tentacle, which slid writhing\\ndown the steps.\\n\\nJust as we were crowding each other to reach the platform, two more\\narms lashed the air, swooped on the seaman stationed in front of\\nCaptain Nemo, and carried the fellow away with irresistible violence.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo gave a shout and leaped outside. We rushed after him.\\n\\nWhat a scene! Seized by the tentacle and glued to its suckers, the\\nunfortunate man was swinging in the air at the mercy of this enormous\\nappendage. He gasped, he choked, he yelled: “Help! Help!” These words,\\npronounced in French, left me deeply stunned! So I had a fellow\\ncountryman on board, perhaps several! I’ll hear his harrowing plea the\\nrest of my life!\\n\\nThe poor fellow was done for. Who could tear him from such a powerful\\ngrip? Even so, Captain Nemo rushed at the devilfish and with a sweep\\nof the ax hewed one more of its arms. His chief officer struggled\\nfuriously with other monsters crawling up the Nautilus’s sides. The\\ncrew battled with flailing axes. The Canadian, Conseil, and I sank our\\nweapons into these fleshy masses. An intense, musky odor filled the\\nair. It was horrible.\\n\\nFor an instant I thought the poor man entwined by the devilfish might\\nbe torn loose from its powerful suction. Seven arms out of eight had\\nbeen chopped off. Brandishing its victim like a feather, one lone\\ntentacle was writhing in the air. But just as Captain Nemo and his\\nchief officer rushed at it, the animal shot off a spout of blackish\\nliquid, secreted by a pouch located in its abdomen. It blinded\\nus. When this cloud had dispersed, the squid was gone, and so was my\\npoor fellow countryman!\\n\\nWhat rage then drove us against these monsters! We lost all\\nself-control. Ten or twelve devilfish had overrun the Nautilus’s\\nplatform and sides. We piled helter-skelter into the thick of these\\nsawed-off snakes, which darted over the platform amid waves of blood\\nand sepia ink. It seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like\\nthe many heads of Hydra. At every thrust Ned Land’s harpoon would\\nplunge into a squid’s sea-green eye and burst it. But my daring\\ncompanion was suddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could\\nnot avoid.\\n\\nOh, my heart nearly exploded with excitement and horror! The squid’s\\nfearsome beak was wide open over Ned Land. The poor man was about to\\nbe cut in half. I ran to his rescue. But Captain Nemo got there\\nfirst. His ax disappeared between the two enormous mandibles, and the\\nCanadian, miraculously saved, stood and plunged his harpoon all the\\nway into the devilfish’s triple heart.\\n\\n“Tit for tat,” Captain Nemo told the Canadian. “I owed it to myself!”\\n\\nNed bowed without answering him.\\n\\nThis struggle had lasted a quarter of an hour. Defeated, mutilated,\\nbattered to death, the monsters finally yielded to us and disappeared\\nbeneath the waves.\\n\\nRed with blood, motionless by the beacon, Captain Nemo stared at the\\nsea that had swallowed one of his companions, and large tears streamed\\nfrom his eyes.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\nThe Gulf Stream\\n\\n\\nTHIS DREADFUL SCENE on April 20 none of us will ever be able to\\nforget. I wrote it up in a state of intense excitement. Later I\\nreviewed my narrative. I read it to Conseil and the Canadian. They\\nfound it accurate in detail but deficient in impact. To convey such\\nsights, it would take the pen of our most famous poet, Victor Hugo,\\nauthor of The Toilers of the Sea.\\n\\nAs I said, Captain Nemo wept while staring at the waves. His grief was\\nimmense. This was the second companion he had lost since we had come\\naboard. And what a way to die! Smashed, strangled, crushed by the\\nfearsome arms of a devilfish, ground between its iron mandibles, this\\nfriend would never rest with his companions in the placid waters of\\ntheir coral cemetery!\\n\\nAs for me, what had harrowed my heart in the thick of this struggle\\nwas the despairing yell given by this unfortunate man. Forgetting his\\nregulation language, this poor Frenchman had reverted to speaking his\\nown mother tongue to fling out one supreme plea! Among the Nautilus’s\\ncrew, allied body and soul with Captain Nemo and likewise fleeing from\\nhuman contact, I had found a fellow countryman! Was he the only\\nrepresentative of France in this mysterious alliance, obviously made\\nup of individuals from different nationalities? This was just one more\\nof those insoluble problems that kept welling up in my mind!\\n\\nCaptain Nemo reentered his stateroom, and I saw no more of him for a\\ngood while. But how sad, despairing, and irresolute he must have felt,\\nto judge from this ship whose soul he was, which reflected his every\\nmood! The Nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading. It drifted back\\nand forth, riding with the waves like a corpse. Its propeller had been\\ndisentangled but was barely put to use. It was navigating at\\nrandom. It couldn’t tear itself away from the setting of this last\\nstruggle, from this sea that had devoured one of its own!\\n\\nTen days went by in this way. It was only on May 1 that the Nautilus\\nopenly resumed its northbound course, after raising the Bahamas at the\\nmouth of Old Bahama Channel. We then went with the current of the\\nsea’s greatest river, which has its own banks, fish, and\\ntemperature. I mean the Gulf Stream.\\n\\nIt is indeed a river that runs independently through the middle of the\\nAtlantic, its waters never mixing with the ocean’s waters. It’s a\\nsalty river, saltier than the sea surrounding it. Its average depth is\\n3,000 feet, its average width sixty miles. In certain localities its\\ncurrent moves at a speed of four kilometers per hour. The unchanging\\nvolume of its waters is greater than that of all the world’s rivers\\ncombined.\\n\\nAs discovered by Commander Maury, the true source of the Gulf Stream,\\nits starting point, if you prefer, is located in the Bay of\\nBiscay. There its waters, still weak in temperature and color, begin\\nto form. It goes down south, skirts equatorial Africa, warms its waves\\nin the rays of the Torrid Zone, crosses the Atlantic, reaches Cape São\\nRoque on the coast of Brazil, and forks into two branches, one going\\nto the Caribbean Sea for further saturation with heat particles. Then,\\nentrusted with restoring the balance between hot and cold temperatures\\nand with mixing tropical and northern waters, the Gulf Stream begins\\nto play its stabilizing role. Attaining a white heat in the Gulf of\\nMexico, it heads north up the American coast, advances as far as\\nNewfoundland, swerves away under the thrust of a cold current from the\\nDavis Strait, and resumes its ocean course by going along a great\\ncircle of the earth on a rhumb line; it then divides into two arms\\nnear the 43rd parallel; one, helped by the northeast trade winds,\\nreturns to the Bay of Biscay and the Azores; the other washes the\\nshores of Ireland and Norway with lukewarm water, goes beyond\\nSpitzbergen, where its temperature falls to 4 degrees centigrade, and\\nfashions the open sea at the pole.\\n\\nIt was on this oceanic river that the Nautilus was then\\nnavigating. Leaving Old Bahama Channel, which is fourteen leagues wide\\nby 350 meters deep, the Gulf Stream moves at the rate of eight\\nkilometers per hour. Its speed steadily decreases as it advances\\nnorthward, and we must pray that this steadiness continues, because,\\nas experts agree, if its speed and direction were to change, the\\nclimates of Europe would undergo disturbances whose consequences are\\nincalculable.\\n\\nNear noon I was on the platform with Conseil. I shared with him the\\nrelevant details on the Gulf Stream. When my explanation was over, I\\ninvited him to dip his hands into its current.\\n\\nConseil did so, and he was quite astonished to experience no sensation\\nof either hot or cold.\\n\\n“That comes,” I told him, “from the water temperature of the Gulf\\nStream, which, as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico, is barely different\\nfrom your blood temperature. This Gulf Stream is a huge heat generator\\nthat enables the coasts of Europe to be decked in eternal\\ngreenery. And if Commander Maury is correct, were one to harness the\\nfull warmth of this current, it would supply enough heat to keep\\nmolten a river of iron solder as big as the Amazon or the Missouri.”\\n\\nJust then the Gulf Stream’s speed was 2.25 meters per second. So\\ndistinct is its current from the surrounding sea, its confined waters\\nstand out against the ocean and operate on a different level from the\\ncolder waters. Murky as well, and very rich in saline material, their\\npure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them. Moreover,\\ntheir line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of the Carolinas,\\nthe Nautilus’s spur cut the waves of the Gulf Stream while its\\npropeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean.\\n\\nThis current swept along with it a whole host of moving\\ncreatures. Argonauts, so common in the Mediterranean, voyaged here in\\nschools of large numbers. Among cartilaginous fish, the most\\nremarkable were rays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third\\nof the body, which was shaped like a huge diamond twenty-five feet\\nlong; then little one-meter sharks, the head large, the snout short\\nand rounded, the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows, the body\\nseemingly covered with scales.\\n\\nAmong bony fish, I noted grizzled wrasse unique to these seas,\\ndeep-water gilthead whose iris has a fiery gleam, one-meter croakers\\nwhose large mouths bristle with small teeth and which let out thin\\ncries, black rudderfish like those I’ve already discussed, blue\\ndorados accented with gold and silver, rainbow-hued parrotfish that\\ncan rival the loveliest tropical birds in coloring, banded blennies\\nwith triangular heads, bluish flounder without scales, toadfish\\ncovered with a crosswise yellow band in the shape of a Greek t, swarms\\nof little freckled gobies stippled with brown spots, lungfish with\\nsilver heads and yellow tails, various specimens of salmon, mullet\\nwith slim figures and a softly glowing radiance that Lacépède\\ndedicated to the memory of his wife, and finally the American cavalla,\\na handsome fish decorated by every honorary order, bedizened with\\ntheir every ribbon, frequenting the shores of this great nation where\\nribbons and orders are held in such low esteem.\\n\\nI might add that during the night, the Gulf Stream’s phosphorescent\\nwaters rivaled the electric glow of our beacon, especially in the\\nstormy weather that frequently threatened us.\\n\\nOn May 8, while abreast of North Carolina, we were across from Cape\\nHatteras once more. There the Gulf Stream is seventy-five miles wide\\nand 210 meters deep. The Nautilus continued to wander at\\nrandom. Seemingly, all supervision had been jettisoned. Under these\\nconditions I admit that we could easily have gotten away. In fact, the\\npopulous shores offered ready refuge everywhere. The sea was plowed\\ncontinuously by the many steamers providing service between the Gulf\\nof Mexico and New York or Boston, and it was crossed night and day by\\nlittle schooners engaged in coastal trade over various points on the\\nAmerican shore. We could hope to be picked up. So it was a promising\\nopportunity, despite the thirty miles that separated the Nautilus from\\nthese Union coasts.\\n\\nBut one distressing circumstance totally thwarted the Canadian’s\\nplans. The weather was thoroughly foul. We were approaching waterways\\nwhere storms are commonplace, the very homeland of tornadoes and\\ncyclones specifically engendered by the Gulf Stream’s current. To face\\na frequently raging sea in a frail skiff was a race to certain\\ndisaster. Ned Land conceded this himself. So he champed at the bit, in\\nthe grip of an intense homesickness that could be cured only by our\\nescape.\\n\\n“Sir,” he told me that day, “it’s got to stop. I want to get to the\\nbottom of this. Your Nemo’s veering away from shore and heading up\\nnorth. But believe you me, I had my fill at the South Pole and I’m not\\ngoing with him to the North Pole.”\\n\\n“What can we do, Ned, since it isn’t feasible to escape right now?”\\n\\n“I keep coming back to my idea. We’ve got to talk to the captain. When\\nwe were in your own country’s seas, you didn’t say a word. Now that\\nwe’re in mine, I intend to speak up. Before a few days are out, I\\nfigure the Nautilus will lie abreast of Nova Scotia, and from there to\\nNewfoundland is the mouth of a large gulf, and the St. Lawrence\\nempties into that gulf, and the St. Lawrence is my own river, the\\nriver running by Quebec, my hometown—and when I think about all this,\\nmy gorge rises and my hair stands on end! Honestly, sir, I’d rather\\njump overboard! I can’t stay here any longer! I’m suffocating!”\\n\\nThe Canadian was obviously at the end of his patience. His vigorous\\nnature couldn’t adapt to this protracted imprisonment. His facial\\nappearance was changing by the day. His moods grew gloomier and\\ngloomier. I had a sense of what he was suffering because I also was\\ngripped by homesickness. Nearly seven months had gone by without our\\nhaving any news from shore. Moreover, Captain Nemo’s reclusiveness,\\nhis changed disposition, and especially his total silence since the\\nbattle with the devilfish all made me see things in a different\\nlight. I no longer felt the enthusiasm of our first days on board. You\\nneeded to be Flemish like Conseil to accept these circumstances,\\nliving in a habitat designed for cetaceans and other denizens of the\\ndeep. Truly, if that gallant lad had owned gills instead of lungs, I\\nthink he would have made an outstanding fish!\\n\\n“Well, sir?” Ned Land went on, seeing that I hadn’t replied.\\n\\n“Well, Ned, you want me to ask Captain Nemo what he intends to do with\\nus?”\\n\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n\\n“Even though he has already made that clear?”\\n\\n“Yes. I want it settled once and for all. Speak just for me, strictly\\non my behalf, if you want.”\\n\\n“But I rarely encounter him. He positively avoids me.”\\n\\n“All the more reason you should go look him up.”\\n\\n“I’ll confer with him, Ned.”\\n\\n“When?” the Canadian asked insistently.\\n\\n“When I encounter him.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax, would you like me to go find him myself?”\\n\\n“No, let me do it. Tomorrow—”\\n\\n“Today,” Ned Land said.\\n\\n“So be it. I’ll see him today,” I answered the Canadian, who, if he\\ntook action himself, would certainly have ruined everything.\\n\\nI was left to myself. His request granted, I decided to dispose of it\\nimmediately. I like things over and done with.\\n\\nI reentered my stateroom. From there I could hear movements inside\\nCaptain Nemo’s quarters. I couldn’t pass up this chance for an\\nencounter. I knocked on his door. I received no reply. I knocked\\nagain, then tried the knob. The door opened.\\n\\nI entered. The captain was there. He was bending over his worktable\\nand hadn’t heard me. Determined not to leave without questioning him,\\nI drew closer. He looked up sharply, with a frowning brow, and said in\\na pretty stern tone:\\n\\n“Oh, it’s you! What do you want?”\\n\\n“To speak with you, captain.”\\n\\n“But I’m busy, sir, I’m at work. I give you the freedom to enjoy your\\nprivacy, can’t I have the same for myself?”\\n\\nThis reception was less than encouraging. But I was determined to give\\nas good as I got.\\n\\n“Sir,” I said coolly, “I need to speak with you on a matter that\\nsimply can’t wait.”\\n\\n“Whatever could that be, sir?” he replied sarcastically. “Have you\\nmade some discovery that has escaped me? Has the sea yielded up some\\nnovel secret to you?”\\n\\nWe were miles apart. But before I could reply, he showed me a\\nmanuscript open on the table and told me in a more serious tone:\\n\\n“Here, Professor Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several\\nlanguages. It contains a summary of my research under the sea, and God\\nwilling, it won’t perish with me. Signed with my name, complete with\\nmy life story, this manuscript will be enclosed in a small, unsinkable\\ncontrivance. The last surviving man on the Nautilus will throw this\\ncontrivance into the sea, and it will go wherever the waves carry it.”\\n\\nThe man’s name! His life story written by himself! So the secret of\\nhis existence might someday be unveiled? But just then I saw this\\nannouncement only as a lead-in to my topic.\\n\\n“Captain,” I replied, “I’m all praise for this idea you’re putting\\ninto effect. The fruits of your research must not be lost. But the\\nmethods you’re using strike me as primitive. Who knows where the winds\\nwill take that contrivance, into whose hands it may fall? Can’t you\\nfind something better? Can’t you or one of your men—”\\n\\n“Never, sir,” the captain said, swiftly interrupting me.\\n\\n“But my companions and I would be willing to safeguard this\\nmanuscript, and if you give us back our freedom—”\\n\\n“Your freedom!” Captain Nemo put in, standing up.\\n\\n“Yes, sir, and that’s the subject on which I wanted to confer with\\nyou. For seven months we’ve been aboard your vessel, and I ask you\\ntoday, in the name of my companions as well as myself, if you intend\\nto keep us here forever.”\\n\\n“Professor Aronnax,” Captain Nemo said, “I’ll answer you today just as\\nI did seven months ago: whoever boards the Nautilus must never leave\\nit.”\\n\\n“What you’re inflicting on us is outright slavery!”\\n\\n“Call it anything you like.”\\n\\n“But every slave has the right to recover his freedom! By any\\nworthwhile, available means!”\\n\\n“Who has denied you that right?” Captain Nemo replied. “Did I ever try\\nto bind you with your word of honor?”\\n\\nThe captain stared at me, crossing his arms.\\n\\n“Sir,” I told him, “to take up this subject a second time would be\\ndistasteful to both of us. So let’s finish what we’ve started. I\\nrepeat: it isn’t just for myself that I raise this issue. To me,\\nresearch is a relief, a potent diversion, an enticement, a passion\\nthat can make me forget everything else. Like you, I’m a man neglected\\nand unknown, living in the faint hope that someday I can pass on to\\nfuture generations the fruits of my labors—figuratively speaking, by\\nmeans of some contrivance left to the luck of winds and waves. In\\nshort, I can admire you and comfortably go with you while playing a\\nrole I only partly understand; but I still catch glimpses of other\\naspects of your life that are surrounded by involvements and secrets\\nthat, alone on board, my companions and I can’t share. And even when\\nour hearts could beat with yours, moved by some of your griefs or\\nstirred by your deeds of courage and genius, we’ve had to stifle even\\nthe slightest token of that sympathy that arises at the sight of\\nsomething fine and good, whether it comes from friend or enemy. All\\nright then! It’s this feeling of being alien to your deepest concerns\\nthat makes our situation unacceptable, impossible, even impossible for\\nme but especially for Ned Land. Every man, by virtue of his very\\nhumanity, deserves fair treatment. Have you considered how a love of\\nfreedom and hatred of slavery could lead to plans of vengeance in a\\ntemperament like the Canadian’s, what he might think, attempt,\\nendeavor . . . ?”\\n\\nI fell silent. Captain Nemo stood up.\\n\\n“Ned Land can think, attempt, or endeavor anything he wants, what\\ndifference is it to me? I didn’t go looking for him! I don’t keep him\\non board for my pleasure! As for you, Professor Aronnax, you’re a man\\nable to understand anything, even silence. I have nothing more to say\\nto you. Let this first time you’ve come to discuss this subject also\\nbe the last, because a second time I won’t even listen.”\\n\\nI withdrew. From that day forward our position was very strained. I\\nreported this conversation to my two companions.\\n\\n“Now we know,” Ned said, “that we can’t expect a thing from this\\nman. The Nautilus is nearing Long Island. We’ll escape, no matter what\\nthe weather.”\\n\\nBut the skies became more and more threatening. There were conspicuous\\nsigns of a hurricane on the way. The atmosphere was turning white and\\nmilky. Slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were followed on the horizon\\nby layers of nimbocumulus. Other low clouds fled swiftly. The sea grew\\ntowering, inflated by long swells. Every bird had disappeared except a\\nfew petrels, friends of the storms. The barometer fell significantly,\\nindicating a tremendous tension in the surrounding haze. The mixture\\nin our stormglass decomposed under the influence of the electricity\\ncharging the air. A struggle of the elements was approaching.\\n\\nThe storm burst during the daytime of May 13, just as the Nautilus was\\ncruising abreast of Long Island, a few miles from the narrows to Upper\\nNew York Bay. I’m able to describe this struggle of the elements\\nbecause Captain Nemo didn’t flee into the ocean depths; instead, from\\nsome inexplicable whim, he decided to brave it out on the surface.\\n\\nThe wind was blowing from the southwest, initially a stiff breeze, in\\nother words, with a speed of fifteen meters per second, which built to\\ntwenty-five meters near three o’clock in the afternoon. This is the\\nfigure for major storms.\\n\\nUnshaken by these squalls, Captain Nemo stationed himself on the\\nplatform. He was lashed around the waist to withstand the monstrous\\nbreakers foaming over the deck. I hoisted and attached myself to the\\nsame place, dividing my wonderment between the storm and this\\nincomparable man who faced it head-on.\\n\\nThe raging sea was swept with huge tattered clouds drenched by the\\nwaves. I saw no more of the small intervening billows that form in the\\ntroughs of the big crests. Just long, soot-colored undulations with\\ncrests so compact they didn’t foam. They kept growing taller. They\\nwere spurring each other on. The Nautilus, sometimes lying on its\\nside, sometimes standing on end like a mast, rolled and pitched\\nfrightfully.\\n\\nNear five o’clock a torrential rain fell, but it lulled neither wind\\nnor sea. The hurricane was unleashed at a speed of forty-five meters\\nper second, hence almost forty leagues per hour. Under these\\nconditions houses topple, roof tiles puncture doors, iron railings\\nsnap in two, and twenty-four-pounder cannons relocate. And yet in the\\nmidst of this turmoil, the Nautilus lived up to that saying of an\\nexpert engineer: “A well-constructed hull can defy any sea!” This\\nsubmersible was no resisting rock that waves could demolish; it was a\\nsteel spindle, obediently in motion, without rigging or masting, and\\nable to brave their fury with impunity.\\n\\nMeanwhile I was carefully examining these unleashed breakers. They\\nmeasured up to fifteen meters in height over a length of 150 to 175\\nmeters, and the speed of their propagation (half that of the wind) was\\nfifteen meters per second. Their volume and power increased with the\\ndepth of the waters. I then understood the role played by these waves,\\nwhich trap air in their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea\\nwhere its oxygen brings life. Their utmost pressure—it has been\\ncalculated—can build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of\\nsurface they strike. It was such waves in the Hebrides that\\nrepositioned a stone block weighing 84,000 pounds. It was their\\nrelatives in the tidal wave on December 23, 1854, that toppled part of\\nthe Japanese city of Tokyo, then went that same day at 700 kilometers\\nper hour to break on the beaches of America.\\n\\nAfter nightfall the storm grew in intensity. As in the 1860 cyclone on\\nRΘunion Island, the barometer fell to 710 millimeters. At the close of\\nday, I saw a big ship passing on the horizon, struggling painfully. It\\nlay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves. It must\\nhave been a steamer on one of those lines out of New York to Liverpool\\nor Le Havre. It soon vanished into the shadows.\\n\\nAt ten o’clock in the evening, the skies caught on fire. The air was\\nstreaked with violent flashes of lightning. I couldn’t stand this\\nbrightness, but Captain Nemo stared straight at it, as if to inhale\\nthe spirit of the storm. A dreadful noise filled the air, a\\ncomplicated noise made up of the roar of crashing breakers, the howl\\nof the wind, claps of thunder. The wind shifted to every point of the\\nhorizon, and the cyclone left the east to return there after passing\\nthrough north, west, and south, moving in the opposite direction of\\nrevolving storms in the southern hemisphere.\\n\\nOh, that Gulf Stream! It truly lives up to its nickname, the Lord of\\nStorms! All by itself it creates these fearsome cyclones through the\\ndifference in temperature between its currents and the superimposed\\nlayers of air.\\n\\nThe rain was followed by a downpour of fire. Droplets of water changed\\ninto exploding tufts. You would have thought Captain Nemo was courting\\na death worthy of himself, seeking to be struck by lightning. In one\\nhideous pitching movement, the Nautilus reared its steel spur into the\\nair like a lightning rod, and I saw long sparks shoot down it.\\n\\nShattered, at the end of my strength, I slid flat on my belly to the\\nhatch. I opened it and went below to the lounge. By then the storm had\\nreached its maximum intensity. It was impossible to stand upright\\ninside the Nautilus.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo reentered near midnight. I could hear the ballast tanks\\nfilling little by little, and the Nautilus sank gently beneath the\\nsurface of the waves.\\n\\nThrough the lounge’s open windows, I saw large, frightened fish\\npassing like phantoms in the fiery waters. Some were struck by\\nlightning right before my eyes!\\n\\nThe Nautilus kept descending. I thought it would find calm again at\\nfifteen meters down. No. The upper strata were too violently\\nagitated. It needed to sink to fifty meters, searching for a resting\\nplace in the bowels of the sea.\\n\\nBut once there, what tranquility we found, what silence, what peace\\nall around us! Who would have known that a dreadful hurricane was then\\nunleashed on the surface of this ocean?\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\nIn Latitude 47° 24’ and Longitude 17° 28’\\n\\n\\nIN THE AFTERMATH of this storm, we were thrown back to the east. Away\\nwent any hope of escaping to the landing places of New York or the\\nSt. Lawrence. In despair, poor Ned went into seclusion like Captain\\nNemo. Conseil and I no longer left each other.\\n\\nAs I said, the Nautilus veered to the east. To be more accurate, I\\nshould have said to the northeast. Sometimes on the surface of the\\nwaves, sometimes beneath them, the ship wandered for days amid these\\nmists so feared by navigators. These are caused chiefly by melting\\nice, which keeps the air extremely damp. How many ships have perished\\nin these waterways as they tried to get directions from the hazy\\nlights on the coast! How many casualties have been caused by these\\nopaque mists! How many collisions have occurred with these reefs,\\nwhere the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind! How many\\nvessels have rammed each other, despite their running lights, despite\\nthe warnings given by their bosun’s pipes and alarm bells!\\n\\nSo the floor of this sea had the appearance of a battlefield where\\nevery ship defeated by the ocean still lay, some already old and\\nencrusted, others newer and reflecting our beacon light on their\\nironwork and copper undersides. Among these vessels, how many went\\ndown with all hands, with their crews and hosts of immigrants, at\\nthese trouble spots so prominent in the statistics: Cape Race,\\nSt. Paul Island, the Strait of Belle Isle, the St. Lawrence estuary!\\nAnd in only a few years, how many victims have been furnished to the\\nobituary notices by the Royal Mail, Inman, and Montreal lines; by\\nvessels named the Solway, the Isis, the Paramatta, the Hungarian, the\\nCanadian, the Anglo-Saxon, the Humboldt, and the United States, all\\nrun aground; by the Arctic and the Lyonnais, sunk in collisions; by\\nthe President, the Pacific, and the City of Glasgow, lost for reasons\\nunknown; in the midst of their gloomy rubble, the Nautilus navigated\\nas if passing the dead in review!\\n\\nBy May 15 we were off the southern tip of the Grand Banks of\\nNewfoundland. These banks are the result of marine sedimentation, an\\nextensive accumulation of organic waste brought either from the\\nequator by the Gulf Stream’s current, or from the North Pole by the\\ncountercurrent of cold water that skirts the American coast. Here,\\ntoo, erratically drifting chunks collect from the ice breakup. Here a\\nhuge boneyard forms from fish, mollusks, and zoophytes dying over it\\nby the billions.\\n\\nThe sea is of no great depth at the Grand Banks. A few hundred fathoms\\nat best. But to the south there is a deep, suddenly occurring\\ndepression, a 3,000-meter pit. Here the Gulf Stream widens. Its waters\\ncome to full bloom. It loses its speed and temperature, but it turns\\ninto a sea.\\n\\nAmong the fish that the Nautilus startled on its way, I’ll mention a\\none-meter lumpfish, blackish on top with orange on the belly and rare\\namong its brethren in that it practices monogamy, a good-sized\\neelpout, a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent, wolffish\\nwith big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine’s, viviparous\\nblennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those of snakes,\\nbloated gobio (or black gudgeon) measuring two decimeters, grenadiers\\nwith long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow, speedy fish\\nventuring far from their High Arctic seas.\\n\\nOur nets also hauled in a bold, daring, vigorous, and muscular fish\\narmed with prickles on its head and stings on its fins, a real\\nscorpion measuring two to three meters, the ruthless enemy of cod,\\nblennies, and salmon; it was the bullhead of the northerly seas, a\\nfish with red fins and a brown body covered with nodules. The\\nNautilus’s fishermen had some trouble getting a grip on this animal,\\nwhich, thanks to the formation of its gill covers, can protect its\\nrespiratory organs from any parching contact with the air and can live\\nout of water for a good while.\\n\\nAnd I’ll mention—for the record—some little banded blennies that\\nfollow ships into the northernmost seas, sharp-snouted carp exclusive\\nto the north Atlantic, scorpionfish, and lastly the gadoid family,\\nchiefly the cod species, which I detected in their waters of choice\\nover these inexhaustible Grand Banks.\\n\\nBecause Newfoundland is simply an underwater peak, you could call\\nthese cod mountain fish. While the Nautilus was clearing a path\\nthrough their tight ranks, Conseil couldn’t refrain from making this\\ncomment:\\n\\n“Mercy, look at these cod!” he said. “Why, I thought cod were flat,\\nlike dab or sole!”\\n\\n“Innocent boy!” I exclaimed. “Cod are flat only at the grocery store,\\nwhere they’re cut open and spread out on display. But in the water\\nthey’re like mullet, spindle-shaped and perfectly built for speed.”\\n\\n“I can easily believe master,” Conseil replied. “But what crowds of\\nthem! What swarms!”\\n\\n“Bah! My friend, there’d be many more without their enemies,\\nscorpionfish and human beings! Do you know how many eggs have been\\ncounted in a single female?”\\n\\n“I’ll go all out,” Conseil replied. “500,000.”\\n\\n“11,000,000, my friend.”\\n\\n“11,000,000! I refuse to accept that until I count them myself.”\\n\\n“So count them, Conseil. But it would be less work to believe\\nme. Besides, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Americans, Danes, and Norwegians\\ncatch these cod by the thousands. They’re eaten in prodigious\\nquantities, and without the astonishing fertility of these fish, the\\nseas would soon be depopulated of them. Accordingly, in England and\\nAmerica alone, 5,000 ships manned by 75,000 seamen go after cod. Each\\nship brings back an average catch of 4,400 fish, making\\n22,000,000. Off the coast of Norway, the total is the same.”\\n\\n“Fine,” Conseil replied, “I’ll take master’s word for it. I won’t\\ncount them.”\\n\\n“Count what?”\\n\\n“Those 11,000,000 eggs. But I’ll make one comment.”\\n\\n“What’s that?”\\n\\n“If all their eggs hatched, just four codfish could feed England,\\nAmerica, and Norway.”\\n\\nAs we skimmed the depths of the Grand Banks, I could see perfectly\\nthose long fishing lines, each armed with 200 hooks, that every boat\\ndangled by the dozens. The lower end of each line dragged the bottom\\nby means of a small grappling iron, and at the surface it was secured\\nto the buoy-rope of a cork float. The Nautilus had to maneuver\\nshrewdly in the midst of this underwater spiderweb.\\n\\nBut the ship didn’t stay long in these heavily traveled waterways. It\\nwent up to about latitude 42 degrees. This brought it abreast of\\nSt. John’s in Newfoundland and Heart’s Content, where the Atlantic\\nCable reaches its end point.\\n\\nInstead of continuing north, the Nautilus took an easterly heading, as\\nif to go along this plateau on which the telegraph cable rests, where\\nmultiple soundings have given the contours of the terrain with the\\nutmost accuracy.\\n\\nIt was on May 17, about 500 miles from Heart’s Content and 2,800\\nmeters down, that I spotted this cable lying on the seafloor. Conseil,\\nwhom I hadn’t alerted, mistook it at first for a gigantic sea snake\\nand was gearing up to classify it in his best manner. But I\\nenlightened the fine lad and let him down gently by giving him various\\ndetails on the laying of this cable.\\n\\nThe first cable was put down during the years 1857-1858; but after\\ntransmitting about 400 telegrams, it went dead. In 1863 engineers\\nbuilt a new cable that measured 3,400 kilometers, weighed 4,500 metric\\ntons, and was shipped aboard the Great Eastern. This attempt also\\nfailed.\\n\\nNow then, on May 25 while submerged to a depth of 3,836 meters, the\\nNautilus lay in precisely the locality where this second cable\\nsuffered the rupture that ruined the undertaking. It happened 638\\nmiles from the coast of Ireland. At around two o’clock in the\\nafternoon, all contact with Europe broke off. The electricians on\\nboard decided to cut the cable before fishing it up, and by eleven\\no’clock that evening they had retrieved the damaged part. They\\nrepaired the joint and its splice; then the cable was resubmerged. But\\na few days later it snapped again and couldn’t be recovered from the\\nocean depths.\\n\\nThese Americans refused to give up. The daring Cyrus Field, who had\\nrisked his whole fortune to promote this undertaking, called for a new\\nbond issue. It sold out immediately. Another cable was put down under\\nbetter conditions. Its sheaves of conducting wire were insulated\\nwithin a gutta-percha covering, which was protected by a padding of\\ntextile material enclosed in a metal sheath. The Great Eastern put\\nback to sea on July 13, 1866.\\n\\nThe operation proceeded apace. Yet there was one hitch. As they\\ngradually unrolled this third cable, the electricians observed on\\nseveral occasions that someone had recently driven nails into it,\\ntrying to damage its core. Captain Anderson, his officers, and the\\nengineers put their heads together, then posted a warning that if the\\nculprit were detected, he would be thrown overboard without a\\ntrial. After that, these villainous attempts were not repeated.\\n\\nBy July 23 the Great Eastern was lying no farther than 800 kilometers\\nfrom Newfoundland when it received telegraphed news from Ireland of an\\narmistice signed between Prussia and Austria after the Battle of\\nSadova. Through the mists on the 27th, it sighted the port of Heart’s\\nContent. The undertaking had ended happily, and in its first dispatch,\\nyoung America addressed old Europe with these wise words so rarely\\nunderstood: “Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of\\ngood will.”\\n\\nI didn’t expect to find this electric cable in mint condition, as it\\nlooked on leaving its place of manufacture. The long snake was covered\\nwith seashell rubble and bristling with foraminifera; a crust of caked\\ngravel protected it from any mollusks that might bore into it. It\\nrested serenely, sheltered from the sea’s motions, under a pressure\\nfavorable to the transmission of that electric spark that goes from\\nAmerica to Europe in 32/100 of a second. This cable will no doubt last\\nindefinitely because, as observers note, its gutta-percha casing is\\nimproved by a stay in salt water.\\n\\nBesides, on this well-chosen plateau, the cable never lies at depths\\nthat could cause a break. The Nautilus followed it to its lowest\\nreaches, located 4,431 meters down, and even there it rested without\\nany stress or strain. Then we returned to the locality where the 1863\\naccident had taken place.\\n\\nThere the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide, into which\\nyou could fit Mt. Blanc without its summit poking above the surface of\\nthe waves. This valley is closed off to the east by a sheer wall 2,000\\nmeters high. We arrived there on May 28, and the Nautilus lay no\\nfarther than 150 kilometers from Ireland.\\n\\nWould Captain Nemo head up north and beach us on the British Isles?\\nNo. Much to my surprise, he went back down south and returned to\\nEuropean seas. As we swung around the Emerald Isle, I spotted Cape\\nClear for an instant, plus the lighthouse on Fastnet Rock that guides\\nall those thousands of ships setting out from Glasgow or Liverpool.\\n\\nAn important question then popped into my head. Would the Nautilus\\ndare to tackle the English Channel? Ned Land (who promptly reappeared\\nafter we hugged shore) never stopped questioning me. What could I\\nanswer him? Captain Nemo remained invisible. After giving the Canadian\\na glimpse of American shores, was he about to show me the coast of\\nFrance?\\n\\nBut the Nautilus kept gravitating southward. On May 30, in sight of\\nLand’s End, it passed between the lowermost tip of England and the\\nScilly Islands, which it left behind to starboard.\\n\\nIf it was going to enter the English Channel, it clearly needed to\\nhead east. It did not.\\n\\nAll day long on May 31, the Nautilus swept around the sea in a series\\nof circles that had me deeply puzzled. It seemed to be searching for a\\nlocality that it had some trouble finding. At noon Captain Nemo\\nhimself came to take our bearings. He didn’t address a word to me. He\\nlooked gloomier than ever. What was filling him with such sadness? Was\\nit our proximity to these European shores? Was he reliving his\\nmemories of that country he had left behind? If so, what did he feel?\\nRemorse or regret? For a good while these thoughts occupied my mind,\\nand I had a hunch that fate would soon give away the captain’s\\nsecrets.\\n\\nThe next day, June 1, the Nautilus kept to the same tack. It was\\nobviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean. Just as on\\nthe day before, Captain Nemo came to take the altitude of the sun. The\\nsea was smooth, the skies clear. Eight miles to the east, a big\\nsteamship was visible on the horizon line. No flag was flapping from\\nthe gaff of its fore-and-aft sail, and I couldn’t tell its\\nnationality.\\n\\nA few minutes before the sun passed its zenith, Captain Nemo raised\\nhis sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision. The\\nabsolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation. The Nautilus\\nlay motionless, neither rolling nor pitching.\\n\\nI was on the platform just then. After determining our position, the\\ncaptain pronounced only these words:\\n\\n“It’s right here!”\\n\\nHe went down the hatch. Had he seen that vessel change course and\\nseemingly head toward us? I’m unable to say.\\n\\nI returned to the lounge. The hatch closed, and I heard water hissing\\nin the ballast tanks. The Nautilus began to sink on a vertical line,\\nbecause its propeller was in check and no longer furnished any forward\\nmotion.\\n\\nSome minutes later it stopped at a depth of 833 meters and came to\\nrest on the seafloor.\\n\\nThe ceiling lights in the lounge then went out, the panels opened, and\\nthrough the windows I saw, for a half-mile radius, the sea brightly\\nlit by the beacon’s rays.\\n\\nI looked to port and saw nothing but the immenseness of these tranquil\\nwaters.\\n\\nTo starboard, a prominent bulge on the sea bottom caught my\\nattention. You would have thought it was some ruin enshrouded in a\\ncrust of whitened seashells, as if under a mantle of snow. Carefully\\nexamining this mass, I could identify the swollen outlines of a ship\\nshorn of its masts, which must have sunk bow first. This casualty\\ncertainly dated from some far-off time. To be so caked with the\\nlimestone of these waters, this wreckage must have spent many a year\\non the ocean floor.\\n\\nWhat ship was this? Why had the Nautilus come to visit its grave? Was\\nit something other than a maritime accident that had dragged this\\ncraft under the waters?\\n\\nI wasn’t sure what to think, but next to me I heard Captain Nemo’s\\nvoice slowly say:\\n\\n“Originally this ship was christened the Marseillais. It carried\\nseventy-four cannons and was launched in 1762. On August 13, 1778,\\ncommanded by La Poype-Vertrieux, it fought valiantly against the\\nPreston. On July 4, 1779, as a member of the squadron under Admiral\\nd’Estaing, it assisted in the capture of the island of Grenada. On\\nSeptember 5, 1781, under the Count de Grasse, it took part in the\\nBattle of Chesapeake Bay. In 1794 the new Republic of France changed\\nthe name of this ship. On April 16 of that same year, it joined the\\nsquadron at Brest under Rear Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, who was\\nentrusted with escorting a convoy of wheat coming from America under\\nthe command of Admiral Van Stabel. In this second year of the French\\nRevolutionary Calendar, on the 11th and 12th days in the Month of\\nPasture, this squadron fought an encounter with English vessels. Sir,\\ntoday is June 1, 1868, or the 13th day in the Month of\\nPasture. Seventy-four years ago to the day, at this very spot in\\nlatitude 47 degrees 24’ and longitude 17 degrees 28’, this ship sank\\nafter a heroic battle; its three masts gone, water in its hold, a\\nthird of its crew out of action, it preferred to go to the bottom with\\nits 356 seamen rather than surrender; and with its flag nailed up on\\nthe afterdeck, it disappeared beneath the waves to shouts of ‘Long\\nlive the Republic!’”\\n\\n“This is the Avenger!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Yes, sir! The Avenger! A splendid name!” Captain Nemo murmured,\\ncrossing his arms.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\nA Mass Execution\\n\\n\\nTHE WAY HE SAID THIS, the unexpectedness of this scene, first the\\nbiography of this patriotic ship, then the excitement with which this\\neccentric individual pronounced these last words—the name Avenger\\nwhose significance could not escape me—all this, taken together, had a\\nprofound impact on my mind. My eyes never left the captain. Hands\\noutstretched toward the sea, he contemplated the proud wreck with\\nblazing eyes. Perhaps I would never learn who he was, where he came\\nfrom or where he was heading, but more and more I could see a\\ndistinction between the man and the scientist. It was no ordinary\\nmisanthropy that kept Captain Nemo and his companions sequestered\\ninside the Nautilus’s plating, but a hate so monstrous or so sublime\\nthat the passing years could never weaken it.\\n\\nDid this hate also hunger for vengeance? Time would soon tell.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Nautilus rose slowly to the surface of the sea, and I\\nwatched the Avenger’s murky shape disappearing little by little. Soon\\na gentle rolling told me that we were afloat in the open air.\\n\\nJust then a hollow explosion was audible. I looked at the captain. The\\ncaptain did not stir.\\n\\n“Captain?” I said.\\n\\nHe didn’t reply.\\n\\nI left him and climbed onto the platform. Conseil and the Canadian\\nwere already there.\\n\\n“What caused that explosion?” I asked.\\n\\n“A cannon going off,” Ned Land replied.\\n\\nI stared in the direction of the ship I had spotted. It was heading\\ntoward the Nautilus, and you could tell it had put on steam. Six miles\\nseparated it from us.\\n\\n“What sort of craft is it, Ned?”\\n\\n“From its rigging and its low masts,” the Canadian replied, “I bet\\nit’s a warship. Here’s hoping it pulls up and sinks this damned\\nNautilus!”\\n\\n“Ned my friend,” Conseil replied, “what harm could it do the Nautilus?\\nWill it attack us under the waves? Will it cannonade us at the bottom\\nof the sea?”\\n\\n“Tell me, Ned,” I asked, “can you make out the nationality of that\\ncraft?”\\n\\nCreasing his brow, lowering his lids, and puckering the corners of his\\neyes, the Canadian focused the full power of his gaze on the ship for\\na short while.\\n\\n“No, sir,” he replied. “I can’t make out what nation it’s from. It’s\\nflying no flag. But I’ll swear it’s a warship, because there’s a long\\npennant streaming from the peak of its mainmast.”\\n\\nFor a quarter of an hour, we continued to watch the craft bearing down\\non us. But it was inconceivable to me that it had discovered the\\nNautilus at such a distance, still less that it knew what this\\nunderwater machine really was.\\n\\nSoon the Canadian announced that the craft was a big battleship, a\\ndouble-decker ironclad complete with ram. Dark, dense smoke burst from\\nits two funnels. Its furled sails merged with the lines of its\\nyardarms. The gaff of its fore-and-aft sail flew no flag. Its distance\\nstill kept us from distinguishing the colors of its pennant, which was\\nfluttering like a thin ribbon.\\n\\nIt was coming on fast. If Captain Nemo let it approach, a chance for\\nsalvation might be available to us.\\n\\n“Sir,” Ned Land told me, “if that boat gets within a mile of us, I’m\\njumping overboard, and I suggest you follow suit.”\\n\\nI didn’t reply to the Canadian’s proposition but kept watching the\\nship, which was looming larger on the horizon. Whether it was English,\\nFrench, American, or Russian, it would surely welcome us aboard if we\\ncould just get to it.\\n\\n“Master may recall,” Conseil then said, “that we have some experience\\nwith swimming. He can rely on me to tow him to that vessel, if he’s\\nagreeable to going with our friend Ned.”\\n\\nBefore I could reply, white smoke streamed from the battleship’s\\nbow. Then, a few seconds later, the waters splashed astern of the\\nNautilus, disturbed by the fall of a heavy object. Soon after, an\\nexplosion struck my ears.\\n\\n“What’s this? They’re firing at us!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Good lads!” the Canadian muttered.\\n\\n“That means they don’t see us as castaways clinging to some wreckage!”\\n\\n“With all due respect to master—gracious!” Conseil put in, shaking off\\nthe water that had sprayed over him from another shell. “With all due\\nrespect to master, they’ve discovered the narwhale and they’re\\ncannonading the same.”\\n\\n“But it must be clear to them,” I exclaimed, “that they’re dealing\\nwith human beings.”\\n\\n“Maybe that’s why!” Ned Land replied, staring hard at me.\\n\\nThe full truth dawned on me. Undoubtedly people now knew where they\\nstood on the existence of this so-called monster. Undoubtedly the\\nlatter’s encounter with the Abraham Lincoln, when the Canadian hit it\\nwith his harpoon, had led Commander Farragut to recognize the narwhale\\nas actually an underwater boat, more dangerous than any unearthly\\ncetacean!\\n\\nYes, this had to be the case, and undoubtedly they were now chasing\\nthis dreadful engine of destruction on every sea!\\n\\nDreadful indeed, if, as we could assume, Captain Nemo had been using\\nthe Nautilus in works of vengeance! That night in the middle of the\\nIndian Ocean, when he imprisoned us in the cell, hadn’t he attacked\\nsome ship? That man now buried in the coral cemetery, wasn’t he the\\nvictim of some collision caused by the Nautilus? Yes, I repeat: this\\nhad to be the case. One part of Captain Nemo’s secret life had been\\nunveiled. And now, even though his identity was still unknown, at\\nleast the nations allied against him knew they were no longer hunting\\nsome fairy-tale monster, but a man who had sworn an implacable hate\\ntoward them!\\n\\nThis whole fearsome sequence of events appeared in my mind’s\\neye. Instead of encountering friends on this approaching ship, we\\nwould find only pitiless enemies.\\n\\nMeanwhile shells fell around us in increasing numbers. Some, meeting\\nthe liquid surface, would ricochet and vanish into the sea at\\nconsiderable distances. But none of them reached the Nautilus.\\n\\nBy then the ironclad was no more than three miles off. Despite its\\nviolent cannonade, Captain Nemo hadn’t appeared on the platform. And\\nyet if one of those conical shells had scored a routine hit on the\\nNautilus’s hull, it could have been fatal to him.\\n\\nThe Canadian then told me:\\n\\n“Sir, we’ve got to do everything we can to get out of this jam! Let’s\\nsignal them! Damnation! Maybe they’ll realize we’re decent people!”\\n\\nNed Land pulled out his handkerchief to wave it in the air. But he had\\nbarely unfolded it when he was felled by an iron fist, and despite his\\ngreat strength, he tumbled to the deck.\\n\\n“Scum!” the captain shouted. “Do you want to be nailed to the\\nNautilus’s spur before it charges that ship?”\\n\\nDreadful to hear, Captain Nemo was even more dreadful to see. His face\\nwas pale from some spasm of his heart, which must have stopped beating\\nfor an instant. His pupils were hideously contracted. His voice was no\\nlonger speaking, it was bellowing. Bending from the waist, he shook\\nthe Canadian by the shoulders.\\n\\nThen, dropping Ned and turning to the battleship, whose shells were\\nshowering around him:\\n\\n“O ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am!” he shouted in his\\npowerful voice. “And I don’t need your colors to recognize you! Look!\\nI’ll show you mine!”\\n\\nAnd in the bow of the platform, Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag,\\nlike the one he had left planted at the South Pole.\\n\\nJust then a shell hit the Nautilus’s hull obliquely, failed to breach\\nit, ricocheted near the captain, and vanished into the sea.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo shrugged his shoulders. Then, addressing me:\\n\\n“Go below!” he told me in a curt tone. “You and your companions, go\\nbelow!”\\n\\n“Sir,” I exclaimed, “are you going to attack this ship?”\\n\\n“Sir, I’m going to sink it.”\\n\\n“You wouldn’t!”\\n\\n“I will,” Captain Nemo replied icily. “You’re ill-advised to pass\\njudgment on me, sir. Fate has shown you what you weren’t meant to\\nsee. The attack has come. Our reply will be dreadful. Get back\\ninside!”\\n\\n“From what country is that ship?”\\n\\n“You don’t know? Fine, so much the better! At least its nationality\\nwill remain a secret to you. Go below!”\\n\\nThe Canadian, Conseil, and I could only obey. Some fifteen of the\\nNautilus’s seamen surrounded their captain and stared with a feeling\\nof implacable hate at the ship bearing down on them. You could feel\\nthe same spirit of vengeance enkindling their every soul.\\n\\nI went below just as another projectile scraped the Nautilus’s hull,\\nand I heard the captain exclaim:\\n\\n“Shoot, you demented vessel! Shower your futile shells! You won’t\\nescape the Nautilus’s spur! But this isn’t the place where you’ll\\nperish! I don’t want your wreckage mingling with that of the Avenger!”\\n\\nI repaired to my stateroom. The captain and his chief officer stayed\\non the platform. The propeller was set in motion. The Nautilus swiftly\\nretreated, putting us outside the range of the vessel’s shells. But\\nthe chase continued, and Captain Nemo was content to keep his\\ndistance.\\n\\nNear four o’clock in the afternoon, unable to control the impatience\\nand uneasiness devouring me, I went back to the central\\ncompanionway. The hatch was open. I ventured onto the platform. The\\ncaptain was still strolling there, his steps agitated. He stared at\\nthe ship, which stayed to his leeward five or six miles off. He was\\ncircling it like a wild beast, drawing it eastward, letting it chase\\nafter him. Yet he didn’t attack. Was he, perhaps, still undecided?\\n\\nI tried to intervene one last time. But I had barely queried Captain\\nNemo when the latter silenced me:\\n\\n“I’m the law, I’m the tribunal! I’m the oppressed, and there are my\\noppressors! Thanks to them, I’ve witnessed the destruction of\\neverything I loved, cherished, and venerated—homeland, wife, children,\\nfather, and mother! There lies everything I hate! Not another word out\\nof you!”\\n\\nI took a last look at the battleship, which was putting on steam. Then\\nI rejoined Ned and Conseil.\\n\\n“We’ll escape!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Good,” Ned put in. “Where’s that ship from?”\\n\\n“I’ve no idea. But wherever it’s from, it will sink before\\nnightfall. In any event, it’s better to perish with it than be\\naccomplices in some act of revenge whose merits we can’t gauge.”\\n\\n“That’s my feeling,” Ned Land replied coolly. “Let’s wait for\\nnightfall.”\\n\\nNight fell. A profound silence reigned on board. The compass indicated\\nthat the Nautilus hadn’t changed direction. I could hear the beat of\\nits propeller, churning the waves with steady speed. Staying on the\\nsurface of the water, it rolled gently, sometimes to one side,\\nsometimes to the other.\\n\\nMy companions and I had decided to escape as soon as the vessel came\\nclose enough for us to be heard—or seen, because the moon would wax\\nfull in three days and was shining brightly. Once we were aboard that\\nship, if we couldn’t ward off the blow that threatened it, at least we\\ncould do everything that circumstances permitted. Several times I\\nthought the Nautilus was about to attack. But it was content to let\\nits adversary approach, and then it would quickly resume its\\nretreating ways.\\n\\nPart of the night passed without incident. We kept watch for an\\nopportunity to take action. We talked little, being too keyed up. Ned\\nLand was all for jumping overboard. I forced him to wait. As I saw it,\\nthe Nautilus would attack the double-decker on the surface of the\\nwaves, and then it would be not only possible but easy to escape.\\n\\nAt three o’clock in the morning, full of uneasiness, I climbed onto\\nthe platform. Captain Nemo hadn’t left it. He stood in the bow next to\\nhis flag, which a mild breeze was unfurling above his head. His eyes\\nnever left that vessel. The extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed\\nto attract it, beguile it, and draw it more surely than if he had it\\nin tow!\\n\\nThe moon then passed its zenith. Jupiter was rising in the east. In\\nthe midst of this placid natural setting, sky and ocean competed with\\neach other in tranquility, and the sea offered the orb of night the\\nloveliest mirror ever to reflect its image.\\n\\nAnd when I compared this deep calm of the elements with all the fury\\nseething inside the plating of this barely perceptible Nautilus, I\\nshivered all over.\\n\\nThe vessel was two miles off. It drew nearer, always moving toward the\\nphosphorescent glow that signaled the Nautilus’s presence. I saw its\\ngreen and red running lights, plus the white lantern hanging from the\\nlarge stay of its foremast. Hazy flickerings were reflected on its\\nrigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the\\nlimit. Showers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its\\nfunnels, spangling the air with stars.\\n\\nI stood there until six o’clock in the morning, Captain Nemo never\\nseeming to notice me. The vessel lay a mile and a half off, and with\\nthe first glimmers of daylight, it resumed its cannonade. The time\\ncouldn’t be far away when the Nautilus would attack its adversary, and\\nmy companions and I would leave forever this man I dared not judge.\\n\\nI was about to go below to alert them, when the chief officer climbed\\nonto the platform. Several seamen were with him. Captain Nemo didn’t\\nsee them, or didn’t want to see them. They carried out certain\\nprocedures that, on the Nautilus, you could call “clearing the decks\\nfor action.” They were quite simple. The manropes that formed a\\nhandrail around the platform were lowered. Likewise the pilothouse and\\nthe beacon housing were withdrawn into the hull until they lay exactly\\nflush with it. The surface of this long sheet-iron cigar no longer\\noffered a single protrusion that could hamper its maneuvers.\\n\\nI returned to the lounge. The Nautilus still emerged above the\\nsurface. A few morning gleams infiltrated the liquid strata. Beneath\\nthe undulations of the billows, the windows were enlivened by the\\nblushing of the rising sun. That dreadful day of June 2 had dawned.\\n\\nAt seven o’clock the log told me that the Nautilus had reduced\\nspeed. I realized that it was letting the warship approach. Moreover,\\nthe explosions grew more intensely audible. Shells furrowed the water\\naround us, drilling through it with an odd hissing sound.\\n\\n“My friends,” I said, “it’s time. Let’s shake hands, and may God be\\nwith us!”\\n\\nNed Land was determined, Conseil calm, I myself nervous and barely in\\ncontrol.\\n\\nWe went into the library. Just as I pushed open the door leading to\\nthe well of the central companionway, I heard the hatch close sharply\\noverhead.\\n\\nThe Canadian leaped up the steps, but I stopped him. A well-known\\nhissing told me that water was entering the ship’s ballast\\ntanks. Indeed, in a few moments the Nautilus had submerged some meters\\nbelow the surface of the waves.\\n\\nI understood this maneuver. It was too late to take action. The\\nNautilus wasn’t going to strike the double-decker where it was clad in\\nimpenetrable iron armor, but below its waterline, where the metal\\ncarapace no longer protected its planking.\\n\\nWe were prisoners once more, unwilling spectators at the performance\\nof this gruesome drama. But we barely had time to think. Taking refuge\\nin my stateroom, we stared at each other without pronouncing a\\nword. My mind was in a total daze. My mental processes came to a dead\\nstop. I hovered in that painful state that predominates during the\\nperiod of anticipation before some frightful explosion. I waited, I\\nlistened, I lived only through my sense of hearing!\\n\\nMeanwhile the Nautilus’s speed had increased appreciably. So it was\\ngathering momentum. Its entire hull was vibrating.\\n\\nSuddenly I let out a yell. There had been a collision, but it was\\ncomparatively mild. I could feel the penetrating force of the steel\\nspur. I could hear scratchings and scrapings. Carried away with its\\ndriving power, the Nautilus had passed through the vessel’s mass like\\na sailmaker’s needle through canvas!\\n\\nI couldn’t hold still. Frantic, going insane, I leaped out of my\\nstateroom and rushed into the lounge.\\n\\nCaptain Nemo was there. Mute, gloomy, implacable, he was staring\\nthrough the port panel.\\n\\nAn enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters, and the Nautilus,\\nmissing none of its death throes, was descending into the depths with\\nit. Ten meters away, I could see its gaping hull, into which water was\\nrushing with a sound of thunder, then its double rows of cannons and\\nrailings. Its deck was covered with dark, quivering shadows.\\n\\nThe water was rising. Those poor men leaped up into the shrouds, clung\\nto the masts, writhed beneath the waters. It was a human anthill that\\nan invading sea had caught by surprise!\\n\\nParalyzed, rigid with anguish, my hair standing on end, my eyes\\npopping out of my head, short of breath, suffocating, speechless, I\\nstared—I too! I was glued to the window by an irresistible allure!\\n\\nThe enormous vessel settled slowly. Following it down, the Nautilus\\nkept watch on its every movement. Suddenly there was an eruption. The\\nair compressed inside the craft sent its decks flying, as if the\\npowder stores had been ignited. The thrust of the waters was so great,\\nthe Nautilus swerved away.\\n\\nThe poor ship then sank more swiftly. Its mastheads appeared, laden\\nwith victims, then its crosstrees bending under clusters of men,\\nfinally the peak of its mainmast. Then the dark mass disappeared, and\\nwith it a crew of corpses dragged under by fearsome eddies. . . .\\n\\nI turned to Captain Nemo. This dreadful executioner, this true\\narchangel of hate, was still staring. When it was all over, Captain\\nNemo headed to the door of his stateroom, opened it, and entered. I\\nfollowed him with my eyes.\\n\\nOn the rear paneling, beneath the portraits of his heroes, I saw the\\nportrait of a still-youthful woman with two little children. Captain\\nNemo stared at them for a few moments, stretched out his arms to them,\\nsank to his knees, and melted into sobs.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\nThe Last Words of Captain Nemo\\n\\n\\nTHE PANELS CLOSED over this frightful view, but the lights didn’t go\\non in the lounge. Inside the Nautilus all was gloom and silence. It\\nleft this place of devastation with prodigious speed, 100 feet beneath\\nthe waters. Where was it going? North or south? Where would the man\\nflee after this horrible act of revenge?\\n\\nI reentered my stateroom, where Ned and Conseil were waiting\\nsilently. Captain Nemo filled me with insurmountable horror. Whatever\\nhe had once suffered at the hands of humanity, he had no right to mete\\nout such punishment. He had made me, if not an accomplice, at least an\\neyewitness to his vengeance! Even this was intolerable.\\n\\nAt eleven o’clock the electric lights came back on. I went into the\\nlounge. It was deserted. I consulted the various instruments. The\\nNautilus was fleeing northward at a speed of twenty-five miles per\\nhour, sometimes on the surface of the sea, sometimes thirty feet\\nbeneath it.\\n\\nAfter our position had been marked on the chart, I saw that we were\\npassing into the mouth of the English Channel, that our heading would\\ntake us to the northernmost seas with incomparable speed.\\n\\nI could barely glimpse the swift passing of longnose sharks,\\nhammerhead sharks, spotted dogfish that frequent these waters, big\\neagle rays, swarms of seahorse looking like knights on a chessboard,\\neels quivering like fireworks serpents, armies of crab that fled\\nobliquely by crossing their pincers over their carapaces, finally\\nschools of porpoise that held contests of speed with the Nautilus. But\\nby this point observing, studying, and classifying were out of the\\nquestion.\\n\\nBy evening we had cleared 200 leagues up the Atlantic. Shadows\\ngathered and gloom overran the sea until the moon came up.\\n\\nI repaired to my stateroom. I couldn’t sleep. I was assaulted by\\nnightmares. That horrible scene of destruction kept repeating in my\\nmind’s eye.\\n\\nFrom that day forward, who knows where the Nautilus took us in the\\nnorth Atlantic basin? Always at incalculable speed! Always amid the\\nHigh Arctic mists! Did it call at the capes of Spitzbergen or the\\nshores of Novaya Zemlya? Did it visit such uncharted seas as the White\\nSea, the Kara Sea, the Gulf of Ob, the Lyakhov Islands, or those\\nunknown beaches on the Siberian coast? I’m unable to say. I lost track\\nof the passing hours. Time was in abeyance on the ship’s clocks. As\\nhappens in the polar regions, it seemed that night and day no longer\\nfollowed their normal sequence. I felt myself being drawn into that\\nstrange domain where the overwrought imagination of Edgar Allan Poe\\nwas at home. Like his fabled Arthur Gordon Pym, I expected any moment\\nto see that “shrouded human figure, very far larger in its proportions\\nthan any dweller among men,” thrown across the cataract that protects\\nthe outskirts of the pole!\\n\\nI estimate—but perhaps I’m mistaken—that the Nautilus’s haphazard\\ncourse continued for fifteen or twenty days, and I’m not sure how long\\nthis would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended our\\nvoyage. As for Captain Nemo, he was no longer in the picture. As for\\nhis chief officer, the same applied. Not one crewman was visible for a\\nsingle instant. The Nautilus cruised beneath the waters almost\\ncontinuously. When it rose briefly to the surface to renew our air,\\nthe hatches opened and closed as if automated. No more positions were\\nreported on the world map. I didn’t know where we were.\\n\\nI’ll also mention that the Canadian, at the end of his strength and\\npatience, made no further appearances. Conseil couldn’t coax a single\\nword out of him and feared that, in a fit of delirium while under the\\nsway of a ghastly homesickness, Ned would kill himself. So he kept a\\ndevoted watch on his friend every instant.\\n\\nYou can appreciate that under these conditions, our situation had\\nbecome untenable.\\n\\nOne morning—whose date I’m unable to specify—I was slumbering near the\\nfirst hours of daylight, a painful, sickly slumber. Waking up, I saw\\nNed Land leaning over me, and I heard him tell me in a low voice:\\n\\n“We’re going to escape!”\\n\\nI sat up.\\n\\n“When?” I asked.\\n\\n“Tonight. There doesn’t seem to be any supervision left on the\\nNautilus. You’d think a total daze was reigning on board. Will you be\\nready, sir?”\\n\\n“Yes. Where are we?”\\n\\n“In sight of land. I saw it through the mists just this morning,\\ntwenty miles to the east.”\\n\\n“What land is it?”\\n\\n“I’ve no idea, but whatever it is, there we’ll take refuge.”\\n\\n“Yes, Ned! We’ll escape tonight even if the sea swallows us up!”\\n\\n“The sea’s rough, the wind’s blowing hard, but a twenty-mile run in\\nthe Nautilus’s nimble longboat doesn’t scare me. Unknown to the crew,\\nI’ve stowed some food and flasks of water inside.”\\n\\n“I’m with you.”\\n\\n“What’s more,” the Canadian added, “if they catch me, I’ll defend\\nmyself, I’ll fight to the death.”\\n\\n“Then we’ll die together, Ned my friend.”\\n\\nMy mind was made up. The Canadian left me. I went out on the platform,\\nwhere I could barely stand upright against the jolts of the\\nbillows. The skies were threatening, but land lay inside those dense\\nmists, and we had to escape. Not a single day, or even a single hour,\\ncould we afford to lose.\\n\\nI returned to the lounge, dreading yet desiring an encounter with\\nCaptain Nemo, wanting yet not wanting to see him. What would I say to\\nhim? How could I hide the involuntary horror he inspired in me? No! It\\nwas best not to meet him face to face! Best to try and forget him! And\\nyet . . . !\\n\\nHow long that day seemed, the last I would spend aboard the Nautilus!\\nI was left to myself. Ned Land and Conseil avoided speaking to me,\\nafraid they would give themselves away.\\n\\nAt six o’clock I ate supper, but I had no appetite. Despite my\\nrevulsion, I forced it down, wanting to keep my strength up.\\n\\nAt 6:30 Ned Land entered my stateroom. He told me:\\n\\n“We won’t see each other again before we go. At ten o’clock the moon\\nwon’t be up yet. We’ll take advantage of the darkness. Come to the\\nskiff. Conseil and I will be inside waiting for you.”\\n\\nThe Canadian left without giving me time to answer him.\\n\\nI wanted to verify the Nautilus’s heading. I made my way to the\\nlounge. We were racing north-northeast with frightful speed, fifty\\nmeters down.\\n\\nI took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures\\namassed in the museum, this unrivaled collection doomed to perish\\nsomeday in the depths of the seas, together with its curator. I wanted\\nto establish one supreme impression in my mind. I stayed there an\\nhour, basking in the aura of the ceiling lights, passing in review the\\ntreasures shining in their glass cases. Then I returned to my\\nstateroom.\\n\\nThere I dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes. I gathered my notes and\\npacked them tenderly about my person. My heart was pounding\\nmightily. I couldn’t curb its pulsations. My anxiety and agitation\\nwould certainly have given me away if Captain Nemo had seen me.\\n\\nWhat was he doing just then? I listened at the door to his\\nstateroom. I heard the sound of footsteps. Captain Nemo was inside. He\\nhadn’t gone to bed. With his every movement I imagined he would appear\\nand ask me why I wanted to escape! I felt in a perpetual state of\\nalarm. My imagination magnified this sensation. The feeling became so\\nacute, I wondered whether it wouldn’t be better to enter the captain’s\\nstateroom, dare him face to face, brave it out with word and deed!\\n\\nIt was an insane idea. Fortunately I controlled myself and stretched\\nout on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation. My nerves calmed a\\nlittle, but with my brain so aroused, I did a swift review of my whole\\nexistence aboard the Nautilus, every pleasant or unpleasant incident\\nthat had crossed my path since I went overboard from the Abraham\\nLincoln: the underwater hunting trip, the Torres Strait, our running\\naground, the savages of Papua, the coral cemetery, the Suez\\npassageway, the island of Santorini, the Cretan diver, the Bay of\\nVigo, Atlantis, the Ice Bank, the South Pole, our imprisonment in the\\nice, the battle with the devilfish, the storm in the Gulf Stream, the\\nAvenger, and that horrible scene of the vessel sinking with its crew\\n. . . ! All these events passed before my eyes like backdrops\\nunrolling upstage in a theater. In this strange setting Captain Nemo\\nthen grew fantastically. His features were accentuated, taking on\\nsuperhuman proportions. He was no longer my equal, he was the Man of\\nthe Waters, the Spirit of the Seas.\\n\\nBy then it was 9:30. I held my head in both hands to keep it from\\nbursting. I closed my eyes. I no longer wanted to think. A half hour\\nstill to wait! A half hour of nightmares that could drive me insane!\\n\\nJust then I heard indistinct chords from the organ, melancholy\\nharmonies from some undefinable hymn, actual pleadings from a soul\\ntrying to sever its earthly ties. I listened with all my senses at\\nonce, barely breathing, immersed like Captain Nemo in this musical\\ntrance that was drawing him beyond the bounds of this world.\\n\\nThen a sudden thought terrified me. Captain Nemo had left his\\nstateroom. He was in the same lounge I had to cross in order to\\nescape. There I would encounter him one last time. He would see me,\\nperhaps speak to me! One gesture from him could obliterate me, a\\nsingle word shackle me to his vessel!\\n\\nEven so, ten o’clock was about to strike. It was time to leave my\\nstateroom and rejoin my companions.\\n\\nI dared not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo stood before me. I opened\\nthe door cautiously, but as it swung on its hinges, it seemed to make\\na frightful noise. This noise existed, perhaps, only in my\\nimagination!\\n\\nI crept forward through the Nautilus’s dark gangways, pausing after\\neach step to curb the pounding of my heart.\\n\\nI arrived at the corner door of the lounge. I opened it gently. The\\nlounge was plunged in profound darkness. Chords from the organ were\\nreverberating faintly. Captain Nemo was there. He didn’t see me. Even\\nin broad daylight I doubt that he would have noticed me, so completely\\nwas he immersed in his trance.\\n\\nI inched over the carpet, avoiding the tiniest bump whose noise might\\ngive me away. It took me five minutes to reach the door at the far\\nend, which led into the library.\\n\\nI was about to open it when a gasp from Captain Nemo nailed me to the\\nspot. I realized that he was standing up. I even got a glimpse of him\\nbecause some rays of light from the library had filtered into the\\nlounge. He was coming toward me, arms crossed, silent, not walking but\\ngliding like a ghost. His chest was heaving, swelling with sobs. And I\\nheard him murmur these words, the last of his to reach my ears:\\n\\n“O almighty God! Enough! Enough!”\\n\\nWas it a vow of repentance that had just escaped from this man’s\\nconscience . . . ?\\n\\nFrantic, I rushed into the library. I climbed the central\\ncompanionway, and going along the upper gangway, I arrived at the\\nskiff. I went through the opening that had already given access to my\\ntwo companions.\\n\\n“Let’s go, let’s go!” I exclaimed.\\n\\n“Right away!” the Canadian replied.\\n\\nFirst, Ned Land closed and bolted the opening cut into the Nautilus’s\\nsheet iron, using the monkey wrench he had with him. After likewise\\nclosing the opening in the skiff, the Canadian began to unscrew the\\nnuts still bolting us to the underwater boat.\\n\\nSuddenly a noise from the ship’s interior became audible. Voices were\\nanswering each other hurriedly. What was it? Had they spotted our\\nescape? I felt Ned Land sliding a dagger into my hand.\\n\\n“Yes,” I muttered, “we know how to die!”\\n\\nThe Canadian paused in his work. But one word twenty times repeated,\\none dreadful word, told me the reason for the agitation spreading\\naboard the Nautilus. We weren’t the cause of the crew’s concern.\\n\\n“Maelstrom! Maelstrom!” they were shouting.\\n\\nThe Maelstrom! Could a more frightening name have rung in our ears\\nunder more frightening circumstances? Were we lying in the dangerous\\nwaterways off the Norwegian coast? Was the Nautilus being dragged into\\nthis whirlpool just as the skiff was about to detach from its plating?\\n\\nAs you know, at the turn of the tide, the waters confined between the\\nFaroe and Lofoten Islands rush out with irresistible violence. They\\nform a vortex from which no ship has ever been able to\\nescape. Monstrous waves race together from every point of the\\nhorizon. They form a whirlpool aptly called “the ocean’s navel,” whose\\nattracting power extends a distance of fifteen kilometers. It can suck\\ndown not only ships but whales, and even polar bears from the\\nnorthernmost regions.\\n\\nThis was where the Nautilus had been sent accidentally—or perhaps\\ndeliberately—by its captain. It was sweeping around in a spiral whose\\nradius kept growing smaller and smaller. The skiff, still attached to\\nthe ship’s plating, was likewise carried around at dizzying speed. I\\ncould feel us whirling. I was experiencing that accompanying nausea\\nthat follows such continuous spinning motions. We were in dread, in\\nthe last stages of sheer horror, our blood frozen in our veins, our\\nnerves numb, drenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying!\\nAnd what a noise around our frail skiff! What roars echoing from\\nseveral miles away! What crashes from the waters breaking against\\nsharp rocks on the seafloor, where the hardest objects are smashed,\\nwhere tree trunks are worn down and worked into “a shaggy fur,” as\\nNorwegians express it!\\n\\nWhat a predicament! We were rocking frightfully. The Nautilus defended\\nitself like a human being. Its steel muscles were cracking. Sometimes\\nit stood on end, the three of us along with it!\\n\\n“We’ve got to hold on tight,” Ned said, “and screw the nuts down\\nagain! If we can stay attached to the Nautilus, we can still make it\\n. . . !”\\n\\nHe hadn’t finished speaking when a cracking sound occurred. The nuts\\ngave way, and ripped out of its socket, the skiff was hurled like a\\nstone from a sling into the midst of the vortex.\\n\\nMy head struck against an iron timber, and with this violent shock I\\nlost consciousness.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n\\nWE COME TO the conclusion of this voyage under the seas. What happened\\nthat night, how the skiff escaped from the Maelstrom’s fearsome\\neddies, how Ned Land, Conseil, and I got out of that whirlpool, I’m\\nunable to say. But when I regained consciousness, I was lying in a\\nfisherman’s hut on one of the Lofoten Islands. My two companions, safe\\nand sound, were at my bedside clasping my hands. We embraced each\\nother heartily.\\n\\nJust now we can’t even dream of returning to France. Travel between\\nupper Norway and the south is limited. So I have to wait for the\\narrival of a steamboat that provides bimonthly service from North\\nCape.\\n\\nSo it is here, among these gallant people who have taken us in, that\\nI’m reviewing my narrative of these adventures. It is accurate. Not a\\nfact has been omitted, not a detail has been exaggerated. It’s the\\nfaithful record of this inconceivable expedition into an element now\\nbeyond human reach, but where progress will someday make great\\ninroads.\\n\\nWill anyone believe me? I don’t know. Ultimately it’s\\nunimportant. What I can now assert is that I’ve earned the right to\\nspeak of these seas, beneath which in less than ten months, I’ve\\ncleared 20,000 leagues in this underwater tour of the world that has\\nshown me so many wonders across the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Red\\nSea, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the southernmost and\\nnorthernmost seas!\\n\\nBut what happened to the Nautilus? Did it withstand the Maelstrom’s\\nclutches? Is Captain Nemo alive? Is he still under the ocean pursuing\\nhis frightful program of revenge, or did he stop after that latest\\nmass execution? Will the waves someday deliver that manuscript that\\ncontains his full life story? Will I finally learn the man’s name?\\nWill the nationality of the stricken warship tell us the nationality\\nof Captain Nemo?\\n\\nI hope so. I likewise hope that his powerful submersible has defeated\\nthe sea inside its most dreadful whirlpool, that the Nautilus has\\nsurvived where so many ships have perished! If this is the case and\\nCaptain Nemo still inhabits the ocean—his adopted country—may the hate\\nbe appeased in that fierce heart! May the contemplation of so many\\nwonders extinguish the spirit of vengeance in him! May the executioner\\npass away, and the scientist continue his peaceful exploration of the\\nseas! If his destiny is strange, it’s also sublime. Haven’t I\\nencompassed it myself? Didn’t I lead ten months of this otherworldly\\nexistence? Thus to that question asked 6,000 years ago in the Book of\\nEcclesiastes—“Who can fathom the soundless depths?”—two men out of all\\nhumanity have now earned the right to reply.

INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\\ntrademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\\nproviding copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in\\naccordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the\\nproduction, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm\\nelectronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,\\nincluding legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of\\nthe following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this\\nor any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or\\nadditions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any\\nDefect you cause.\\n\\nSection 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\n\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\nwww.gutenberg.org \\n\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \\nArchive Foundation\\n\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\n\\nThe Foundation\\'s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\\nlocations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt\\nLake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to\\ndate contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s web site and\\nofficial page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\n\\nFor additional contact information:\\n\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby\\n    Chief Executive and Director\\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\\n\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\nvolunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\nedition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n'"
